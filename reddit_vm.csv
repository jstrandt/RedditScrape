Can I have a rant please??,12,o6nqcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/o6nqcm/can_i_have_a_rant_please/,1,1624487724.0,"Not sure if the sub allows this but I need to vent and need some sanity right now... 

So I posted in a parenting group on FB how my 18.5 week old has been quieter for the past couple of days. Nothing major I was just wondering if it's a normal part of development. 

Anyway so the majority of comments were delightful and reassuring but then I get one ""any recent vaccines""? And ""has he been vaxxed recently""? Damn I thought... Responded that yes he had a couple almost 3 weeks ago. Cue the sad reacts, angry reacts, comments ""his behaviour is definitely vaccine related"", ""you're poisoning your baby"", ""he's definitely acting weird because of the vaccines"" etc. Plus several unsolicited DMs stating how I'm poisoning and damaging my baby by vaccinating him and trying to sell me spray (I kid you not) to 'detox his skin from the metals'. Honestly I was shocked and just ignored it until people tried to do power moves ""I'm a pediatric nurse who sees this all the time in vaccinated babies"" and then I started defending myself and asking people to remain respectful and stick to the topic at hand. Tried to get some science in there (many laugh reacts in response) but I know there often futile. Honestly there were tens of people on this thread saying ""I came here to say the same thing"" etc. 

So I turn off commenting and edit to say thanks mostly to everyone but not the space for anti-vax opinion so closing comments. THEN I get a fricken message from the fricken admins saying I was being unkind by calling people OVERTLY AGAINST VACCINES anti-vaxxers and that I should either edit my post or delete it. Are you KIDDING me??? Someone literally said I was going to kill my baby and that he needs a detox (from a fricken spray bottle) and I'M being unkind?! Not to mention the thread full of misinformation and links to dodgy websites like whats in the leaflet or whatever it's called. 

Honestly I was so angry that out of all the thousands of things that could have affected my baby's behaviour some people jumped on the vaccines that he had 3 weeks ago, but that message from the admins really was the last straw - I was 'breaking the rules by being unkind' simply by defending my choice to vaccinate and asking people to remain respectful and stick to the topic. 

I'm just raging. I hate that people like this exist and I hate that there is so much distrust in the world I can't ask a simple question without it turning into some anti vax propaganda and a personal attack. I'm so worried for the future generations if kids are being brought up like this. 

That's it. Thanks for listening. Screw AVs.",2021-06-23 22:35:24

Reality,2,o564om,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/o564om/reality/,0,1624311086.0,"Humanity does not live in reality, but rather, in sub-reality. People spend most of their time denying the truth, not seeing things for what they actually are. Initially, their intuition may give them the correct interpretation of something. But then, their social conditioning overrides their intuition, molding that thing into what society wants them to think it is. Thus, they are not able to think for themselves or interpret reality correctly.

In other words, ""reality"" is what actually exists and what is actually going on, as opposed to the façade that society has placed over what actually exists and what is actually going on; nor is reality how one interprets something when in a state of psychological denial.

For example, when it comes to the government informing the public about something, most people simply assume that their government is telling them the truth. But, IN REALITY, these people have absolutely no idea what is actually going on, and do not want to admit such an obvious fact to themselves! In society, critical issues, such as what the government is really doing behind the scenes, are simply blown off as being non-issues. Very convenient indeed.",2021-06-21 21:31:26

"Sobre las vacunas para el COVID19, compilación de textos científicos y opinión personal.",4,lace91,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/lace91/sobre_las_vacunas_para_el_covid19_compilación_de/,1,1612209373.0,"A propósito de los comentarios que he leído y escuchado sobre las vacunas para el COVID19, pero sobre todo de la vacuna rusa Sputnik V, me he dado a la tarea de estudiar algunos textos científicos y hacer una compilación de los mismos para hacerlos de su conocimiento, a continuación les comparto

**SOBRE LA VACUNA RUSA SPUTNIK V**  
The Lancet, una de las revistas médicas más prestigiosas del mundo, publicó los resultados de los ensayos de la primera y la segunda fase de la vacuna rusa SPUTNIK V, que demostraron lo siguiente:

1. La plataforma de vectores adenovirales humanos es eficaz, a pesar de las preocupaciones por la posibilidad de una inmunidad preexistente a los adenovirus.

2. Se seleccionó la dosis segura óptima que permitió lograr una respuesta inmunitaria humoral y celular en el 100 % de los participantes, incluso en aquellos que habían tenido una infección con adenovirus.

3. El uso de dos vectores diferentes permite lograr una respuesta inmune más efectiva.

4. El nivel de anticuerpos contra el SARS-CoV-2 en voluntarios vacunados con Sputnik V fue entre 1,4 y 1,5 veces más alto que el nivel de anticuerpos en los pacientes que se habían recuperado del covid-19.

5. Tiene una eficacia de 91.4 por ciento contra el virus SARS-CoV-2, y de 100 por ciento para evitar los cuadros graves de la enfermedad Covid-19.

Al mismo tiempo, no se encontraron eventos adversos graves en los vacunados con Sputnik V, mientras que para otras vacunas, este parámetro oscila entre el 1 y el 25 por ciento.

Varias otras empresas están utilizando también plataformas basadas en vectores adenovirales humanos para sus vacunas contra el covid-19, como por ejemplo Johnson & Johnson, que usa el vector Ad26, y la china CanSino, que emplea el Ad5 mientras que la Rusa SPUTNIK V utiliza dos vectores adenovirales, el Ad5 y el Ad26.

Vale la pena mencionar que las plataformas para vacunas que usan otros países, como el vector de adenovirus de chimpancé (OXFORD-ASTRA ZENECA, quienes por cierto están estudiando la posibilidad de aplicar de manera conjunta su vacuna y la SPUTNIK V para incrementar su efectividad) o la tecnología de ARN (PFIZER-BIONTECH), nunca antes habían sido utilizadas en vacunas que hayan pasado la FASE 3. Tampoco han sido sometidas a estudios a largo plazo sobre sus posibles efectos secundarios en el cuerpo humano, como por ejemplo los riesgos de desarrollar complicaciones relacionadas con el cáncer o sus efectos sobre la fertilidad.

**Las vacunas de ARN mensajero (PFIZER-BIONTECH-MODERNA).**  
La mayor preocupación con este tipo de vacunas ha sido su inestabilidad, su baja eficiencia para introducirlas en las células y que expresen el antígeno. También ha preocupado el hecho de que el ARN puede estimular reacciones inmunológicas de tipo inflamatorio, por lo que todos estos factores han limitado en parte su desarrollo. El ARN es una molécula muy inestable que requiere condiciones de mantenimiento extremas (de menos 80℃), se degrada muy fácilmente por enzimas y no se internaliza de forma eficiente.

Sin embargo, esta tecnología también tiene ventajas. Es relativamente más barata que otro tipo de vacunas y, sobre todo, permite diseñar una vacuna nueva en un tiempo récord. Una vez que se conoce el genoma del patógeno, en unas semanas se pueden producir los primeros prototipos vacunales, lo que la convierte en una excelente herramienta cuando aparece un patógeno nuevo para el que se necesita una vacuna con urgencia, como en una pandemia. En este caso, la rapidez es un beneficio mayor que el problema de su inestabilidad. Moderna fue capaz de diseñar su vacuna de ARNm contra SARS-CoV-2 tan solo seis semanas después de que el genoma del virus se hiciera público.

**MI OPINIÓN.**  
Por un lado la vacuna rusa aprovecha los modelos de vacunas ya probados, innova en el sentido de usar dos vectores en lugar de uno solo. Es un modelo que, si bien no tiene la efectividad que manifiestan en las vacunas de ARN mensajero, es más segura en términos de efectos secundarios adversos e igual de efectiva que la vacunas que todos conocemos hasta ahora y que nos hemos aplicado.

Por el otro lado Pfizer y otras le apuestan al futuro y a lo económico, puede que en esta ocasión tengan tropezones pero el avance que van a lograr es un ahorro en años de investigación, aún así, como el resto de las vacunas, el reto será que en el mediano y largo plazo resulten eficaces y que sus efectos adversos sean mínimos para poder compararlas con el modelo tradicional de vacunas que, guste o no a políticos y villamelones, es eficaz y seguro.

**¿CONCLUSIÓN?**  
Me encuentro optimista, las vacunas contra el COVID19 comentadas en este texto han demostrado científicamente que podemos seguir confiando en la ciencia para resolver y prevenir problemas de salud como las pandemias. La competencia entre científicos es sana y provoca desarrollos alternativos, lo que nos permite tener varias respuestas a un mismo problema y con ello se abran posibilidades para tomar decisiones que, de acuerdo a cada país, pueden ser más adecuadas para cada uno.

If an antivaxer is attacking you or making baseless/outlandish + unscientific claims, you can use this list of information to shut their arguments down immediately with facts:

\-**Vaccines are extremely safe**: in fact, *no serious adverse events* (besides injection site pain/erythema) have ever actually been proven.

\-Vaccine adverse events are notoriously **OVER** (not under!) reported. It is estimated by a Harvard study using data mining technology + VAERS reports that **adverse events are reported at 100x** (or more) the **rate that they actually occur.**

\-One study found that **97% of ""adverse events""** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects** (like the placebo effect, people believe/imagine they are having symptoms due to fear/expectation)

\-Not **a single case of autism** has ever made it to higher courts, because the **autism + vaccine connection has an overwhelming amount of research debunking it.**

\-in 1986, vaccine manufacturers took **on increased liability** for their product to reassure the public of safety: this is because research has proven without doubt that vaccines are **incredibly safe.** Despite manufacture liability, vaccine manufactures have never actually needed to pay out any amount for any purported ""injury"" claims. The evidence is overwhelming to **debunk these claims.**

\-**Andrew Wakefield,** a public disgrace and conspiracist theorist with multiple agendas, is the **only physician or scientist** to have **ever published a medical paper criticizing vaccine safety**. His paper was later **retracted for fraud** and his licence **revoked**.

\-**Vaccine inserts** list events that occur normally in populations and **do NOT prove any causative association** between vaccines and these purported ""events"". If the events listed in vaccine inserts actually \*caused\* these effects, billions in personal injury lawsuits would be paid out --> which is *not* the case!

\-Unlike what antivaxers claim, it has been proven thoroughly that Gardasil is incredibly safe. The supposed ""injuries"" that circulate the internet in the form of horror stories can be explained psychologically by the phenomenon of mass psychogenic events, instigated by fear + the nocebo effect.

\-The MMR does not cause any adverse neurological events or damage in the brains of laboratory animals, even at doses higher than used in humans.

\-The cumulative effect of the entire vaccination schedule (72 doses in children by the age of 18 today, in 2020) has been completely and thoroughly investigated for safety, and no issues have been found.

\-Vaccines have rigorous long-term safety studies for all potential of carcinogenicity, fertility, and long-term health adverse effects, and no issues have been found.

\-Despite some ethical concerns raised, several vaccinated vs. unvaccinated studies have been conducted. It was found that vaccinated children have significantly lower rates of allergies, chronic health problems, and neurological issues.

\-Vaccines are thought to have a potential neuroprotective and anti-cancer effect, which is still being studied. It is suspected that vaccines may prevent infertility, dementia, and cancer, although further investigation is needed.

\-All clinical trials for vaccines use double-blinded trials with saline placebos, which is the gold standard in medical research.

\-The FDA has an independent taxpayer-funded committee to examine and analyze all raw data from vaccine clinical trials. Scientists and data analysts conducting this research have extensive background testing to ensure no conflicts of interest in any pharmaceutical company. This debunks the myth of ""conflict of interest"" regarding vaccine manufacturers funding their own safety studies for FDA/CDC approval.

\-There are comprehensive laws to prevent the myth of the “revolving door” phenomenon that anti-vaxers like to use as proof of government-pharmaceutical corruption. If a scientist/researcher who investigated vaccine safety has had any financial ties to a pharmaceutical company, they are disqualified from the vaccine approval committee. Similarly, once an individual has worked in the field of vaccine approval for the FDA/CDC, they are unable to accept positions as pharmaceutical-hired scientists. These laws prevent conflicts of interest between vaccine approval and pharmaceutical profit.

\-Studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated infants have thoroughly refuted any claims linking vaccines to SIDS.

\-The USA has very high vaccination rates as well as one of the lowest rates of infant mortality in all developed nations.

\-France, which has a notoriously high rate of vaccine hesitancy, has higher rates of autism, SIDS, and chronic illnesses than other developed countries of similar socioeconomic structure.

\-Autism is “more prevalent” due to more advanced and specific diagnostic criteria. Once diagnostic criteria was established, people of older generations (age 50’s-80’s) were found to have nearly identical rates of autism to those of younger generations (age 40’s and under).

Why are the world’s top vaccine promoters frantically warning us about the unique and frightening dangers inherent in developing a coronavirus vaccine?,1,g1zp4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/g1zp4n/why_are_the_worlds_top_vaccine_promoters/,1,1586981420.0,"From:

[https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/heres-why-bill-gates-wants-indemnity-are-you-willing-to-take-the-risk/](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/heres-why-bill-gates-wants-indemnity-are-you-willing-to-take-the-risk/)

&#x200B;

Why are the world’s top vaccine promoters, like Paul Offit and Peter Hotez, frantically warning us about the unique and frightening dangers inherent in developing a coronavirus vaccine?

Scientists first attempted to [develop coronavirus vaccines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382) after China’s 2002 SARS-CoV outbreak. Teams of US & foreign scientists vaccinated animals with the four most promising vaccines. At first, the experiment seemed successful as all the animals developed a robust antibody response to coronavirus. However, when the scientists exposed the vaccinated animals to the wild virus, the results were horrifying. Vaccinated animals [suffered hyper-immune responses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382) including inflammation throughout their bodies, especially in their lungs. Researchers had seen this same “enhanced immune response” during human testing of the [failed RSV vaccine tests](https://cvi.asm.org/content/23/3/189) in the 1960s. [Two children died](https://cvi.asm.org/content/23/3/189).

In this video footage, Offit, Hotez and even Anthony Fauci (in an unguarded moment), warn that any new coronavirus vaccine could trigger lethal immune reactions “vaccine enhancement” when vaccinated people come in contact with the wild virus. Instead of proceeding with caution, Fauci has made the reckless choice to [fast track](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200316005666/en/Moderna-Announces-Participant-Dosed-NIH-led-Phase-1) vaccines, partially [funded by Gates](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/bill-gates-says-foundation-will-invest-billions-fight-stop-covid-19/MMAFTSVGKZHPTEGYKEQKMRWTWU/), without critical [animal studies](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/11/researchers-rush-to-start-moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-without-usual-animal-testing/) before moving into human clinical trials that could provide early warning of runaway immune response.

Gates (in the video) is so worried about the danger of adverse events that he says vaccines shouldn’t be distributed until governments [agree to indemnity](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/04/09/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-microsoft-co-founder-bill-gates-on-past-pandemic-warnings.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Mail&fbclid=IwAR0RG79OtbdXUpY_ylULT6sY_Xo5D-cBQ0awSo6vGS19VnLGqB9z)against lawsuits. On February 4, 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html), there were only [11 active CV cases](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) in the USA, yet the U.S. quietly pushed through [Federal regulations](https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/prepact/Pages/COVID19.aspx) giving coronavirus vaccine makers full immunity from liability.

I am pregnant but had them as a kid, am i protected?



Arent your risk of getting shingles greatly increased if you have had the chicken pox?



If anti vaxxers get excited that your body builds natural immunity after having the disease, isnt that what vaccines do for your body except your never ""sick""?

BEFORE you jump with your outraged let me clarify why I'm doing this PERHAPS I'm wrong, people won't realized many ""anti-vaxxers"" are just normal parents unsure of what is the right thing to do and they just don't trust institution for good reasons but  all of them are being ridiculized with memes for example, this type of behavior reminds me discussions from circumcised people (supposedly an advantageous practice) fluoride in the water (recently scientifically proven to reduce iq in children), the supposed benefits of Masturbation and porn consumption when I personally have a life changing experience with NOFAP while when you Google Masturbation first page shows articles from the Huffpos, Bustler etc..about the wonders of said habit.

Add this my own personal experience and people I know irl, in my quest for knowledge I found my own vaccination schedule, I got 27 vaccines before I was 18! Mumps, chicken pox, measles included, ironically I got these 3 diseases anyway, mumps at 6, chicken pox at 19 measles at 9-10.

Even worst I'm autistic irl something I'm not proud of (I live in perpetual embarrassment) this only adds more sceptisim honestly I wanted to learn from ""both sides"" but most ""pro-vaccination"" people seems to be unconcerned individuals who only enjoy making jokes and memes about the whole subject I use to be like that until the day I was a father, I have no doubts there are people working to improve the world but let's not forget sometimes science takes a while to catch on maybe they just don't know any better the bad news pharmaceutical companies do have motives to promote vaccination just check the cost of each unit your government have to pay.",2019-09-21 00:15:01

He concluded the article saying they couldn't prove a connection between the MMR vaccine and the gastrointestinal issues because the evidence is inadequate. Nowhere in the article he said there was a link between autism and the vaccine, until Wakefield claimed that it did in a press conferences.

His article was published in *the Lancet*, a well-known medicinal journal, and he was known to be a prestigious and highly regarded doctor( he's the doctor who identify the cause of Crohn's disease), so when the public heard of the vaccine-autism link, the public ate it up, fear arose, and vaccination rates dropped.

The article and his claims are farfetch once you look at the detail. First, the size of his studies was too small, only 12 children, making any connection seem statistically significant. There was only a few variables were studies and according to him, those 12 children exhibited forms of autism (the symptoms were not akin to autism). Not only that, his study didn't have the Ethical Practice Committee approve the study, which is necessary to ensure that the research doesn't harm its participants.

What's worse it that it was discovered after much denial that Wakefield was being funded $800,000 by a personal injury lawyer named Richard Barr, who needed evidence that autism was caused by vaccine for cases of parents of autistic children who were suing pharmaceutical companies for compensation. Five of the 12 children were even clients of Barr. Wakefield's collaborators didn't even know about the money and were furious enough to retract their names for the study. But Wakefield had another motive. He advocated that vaccines need to be safe and tells the public that the current MMR vaccine isn't safe. Prior to his study, he was applying for a vaccine patent, he wanted to make his own MMR vaccine and wanted to get rid of the completion.

Wakefield had his medical license evoked in 2005. This should have been the end of the myth, but sadly no. He moved to the USA and is still highly regarded by people. Now his MMR and autism phase is dying down, but his new topic takes the spotlight, mercury in vaccines.",2019-08-24 21:48:57
For those concerned about thimerosal,1,cuzfzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/cuzfzp/for_those_concerned_about_thimerosal/,1,1566682500.0,"Everyone knows that mercury is harmful of the body as it is classified as a neurotoxin. So the thought of thimerosal being injected into our children and our bodies is concerning, since it does contain some mercury.

But mercury has different forms. The one that is dangerous is methylmercury. In terms of chemistry, it is the combination of a mercury atom to one carbon atom. It is known to be very dangerous to all living beings. Out of all forms of mercury, methylmercury is absorbed the easily and can even cross the blood brain barrier. Since, there are tiny tiny doses of it in contaminated food, like fish, which is why pregnant women are told to avoid seafood.

I wanted to clarify that methylmercury was never used in vaccines. While thimerosal does have mercury, it is not methylmercury. It is ethlymercury.

Ethlymercury has two carbon atoms, instead of one, which drastically changes its properties and abilities. Due to its size, it's hard for it to cross the blood brain barrier and it's quickly excreted.

Despite this, in 2002, thimerosal was removed from nearly all vaccines due to, not under the prove that it is harmful, but the idea that is has the potential for harm from the general public. This might have been due because of an article called ""Autism: A Novel Form of Mercury Poisoning"" . It was published by a group of parents in the 2001 that linked autism to mercury poisoning and the thimerosal was to blame. This article was not reviewed by any medical or scientific professionals, but it stirred up the public enough for the preservative to be removed.",2019-08-24 21:35:00

But without those preservatives, vaccines will have a very short shelf life and then afterward inefficient.  Parents may question if that's enough reason to expose their children to poison. I wanted to reassure and inform that those ingredients are harmless, despite its name and known uses, because of its dosage.

Anything in the world can act as a poison or be completely harmless depending on the dosage. So just because something sounds good or bad doesn't mean that any dosage of it remains so. For example, too much vitamin A can actually poison you and damage your liver.

Here is a list of some ingredients in vaccines and their dosage, as well as some usages:

* Aluminum hydroxide: Used as a adjuvant (helps with efficacy of vaccine) in the DTap (0.625 mg). Also used antacids and in infant formula (0.225 mg per liter).
* Formaldehyde: Prevent growth of harmful bacteria in vaccine. All vaccine combined has 1.2 mg of it, while 1 kg of bananas has 16.3 mg.
* Monosodium Glutamate: Help preserve vaccines and used as a flavor enhancer. Some flu vaccines contain 0.188 mg of MSG, while grape juice can contain 0.258 mg per 100 grams.
* Sodium Chloride: Another name for salt and some vaccine have them to keep them in a state that will not badly affect the cells.
* Sorbitol: Preservative, found naturally in fruits, and also used a sweetener in sugar-free products. MMR vaccine has 15 mg and 1 stick of sugar-free gum has 1.25 g.",2019-08-24 21:17:42

If vaccines are so safe and effective why does the industry need to tell lies? The local news just advertised 1 in 4 measles patients needs to be hospitalized... 

According to

https://www.autism-watch.org/news/lancet.shtml

In 2004, ten of the study's authors issued a ""retraction"" which stated: ""We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient.""

So just how different is that from the studies conclusion? See for yourself - 

""We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described. Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue.

If there is a causal link between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and this syndrome, a rising incidence might be anticipated after the introduction of this vaccine in the UK in 1988...


....We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine.""

Isn't the 2004 ""retraction"" Saying the same thing as the study? Nothing was proved. 

The study was published in 1998.. It was retracted a very long time later. Why did it take so long? 

Some of the claims of fraudulent activities aim at Dr. Wakefield's payment to be a witness or a supposed link to an application for a vaccine patent. 
Have you seen how much money Dr Offit and Plotkin make from all the vaccines. They have the patent on the R in MMR yet they are often called as witness against Dr Wakefield or give expert witness for a news report.

Myth: 1 in 1000 measles cases are fatal,5,b8jhk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/b8jhk7/myth_1_in_1000_measles_cases_are_fatal/,32,1554213095.0,"The 1 in 1000 fatality rate from measles is a known calculation error by the CDC. 

It's actually closer to 1 in 10,000 or 0.01% of cases. 

To put it in perspective, 1 in 10,000 is the same probability of getting struck by lightning in your lifetime. (Howstuffworks.com) 

Proof: https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/critical-calculation-error-in-background-information-for-hearing-on-vaccines-save-lives-what-is-driving-preventable-disease-outbreaks-on-march-5-2019/

Prior to the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, “there were an estimated 3 to 4 million people infected with measles in the United States, and as many as 500 related deaths each year,” which is correct. However, this computes to a number of deaths which, at most, is one in 6,000 (3,000,000 divided by 500). More precisely, between 1959 and 1962, about 400 measles deaths occurred among about 4,000,000 measles cases, which results in a one in 10,000 (0.01%) chance of a child dying from measles, not one in 500 or one in 1,000. By comparison, over 23,000 infant deaths occur every year in the U.S. and thus the chance of a child dying in his or her first year of life is currently one in 170 (0.6%)—this is 60 times the risk of a child dying from measles in 1962, a time period when almost every child had measles by age 15.

The reason this calculation error unfortunately commonly occurs is because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes case-fatality rates based on the number of reported cases only. And, since it is estimated that nearly 90% of measles cases are benign and therefore not reported to the CDC, the widely publicized measles case-fatality rate is a 10-fold miscalculation. Such an error has grave public health consequences.

Herd Immunity is it really achievable?,2,azlm88,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/azlm88/herd_immunity_is_it_really_achievable/,17,1552258302.0,"
In 1933, Dr. Arthur W. Hedrich, a health officer in Chicago, IL observed that during 1900-1930, outbreaks of measles in Boston, MA appeared to be suppressed when 68% of the children contracted the virus.3 Subsequently in the 1930s, Dr. Hedrich observed that after 55% of the child population of Baltimore, MD acquired measles, the rest of the population appeared to be protected. It was that observation that formed the basis for mass vaccination campaigns.4

When the mass vaccination campaign for measles in the U.S. began in earnest in the mid-1960s, the U.S. Public Health Service planned to vaccinate over 55% (based on the Baltimore observation) of the U.S. population, and it announced that it fully expected to eradicate measles by 1967. When that didn’t happen, the Public Health Service came up with vaccination rate figures of 70-75% as the way to ensure herd immunity. When eradication was still not achieved at those rates, public health officials jacked up the rates to 80%, 83%, 85%, and ultimately to 90%.

The process by which the decisions to raise the rates is unclear. Was it based on some scientific methodology or assumptions? Or were the decisions simply made because officials felt pressure to fulfill their promises to fully eradicate measles? Did they ever consider pausing and re-evaluating the original premise behind the theory of herd immunity? Or did they trudge on, arbitrarily raising the bar?

Now the rate is up to 95% to achieve herd immunity. But as we see with the continual outbreaks, even at 95% we still do not have full immunity. In China, the vaccination rates are even higher—99%. But there are also still measles outbreaks there.  So is the answer 100%? And what if at 100% you still get outbreaks? We’ve gone from herd immunity supposedly achieved at 55% to herd immunity that is clearly not achieved even at 95%. At what point will public health officials have to confront the possibility that herd immunity may not be the best theory on which to base vaccination policy?

Before you allow your doctor to inject a concoction of chemicals into their body their bloodstreams you [should be aware of the pros and cons of the vaccine otherwise](https://www.seekandread.com/advantages-disadvantages-vaccinations/) vaccines can be very frightening.

They don’t wish to opt for vaccination without receiving ample information about what these chemicals constitute and whether or not they can have harmful side effects.

I can’t reason with her because she believes everything pro-vaccine is from the government and pharmaceutical companies. Unfortunately, I get the flu every year and got chicken pox last year. I would definitely like to stay on the safe and get at least some vaccinations, what should I do? I am 15, can I legally get vaccines without parental consent?

I've learned not to challenge her on it because it's gotten me nowhere but she views my beliefs as a personal attack on her directly. She runs a supplements company and has traveled the world teaching about the dangers of vaccines and how it caused my youngest brother to get autism. It's actually the entire basis of why she's a Trump supporter because of his stance on the issue, but that's another issue entirely.

 I know the basis of the argument for vaccines (herd-immunity, diseases are worse etc) but our discussions always boil down to sources and generally what or who to believe. She has the assumption that all CDC sympathetic media or articles are in the pockets of big pharma so they can make all their profits through vaccines. I anticipate this being the crux of the argument following this movie. I don't believe I will break through to her but I do hope to get a better understanding of the issue before I go into 2 hours of full propaganda, then to be bombarded with questions. 

Here's a link of a bunch of articles she views as ""proof"" of what she believes:

http://vaccinepapers.org/

 I've gone through most of it and don't really know what to make of them. There's a lot of prefacing for the studies that are mentioned but like I said, I'm no expert. What do some of you make of these links and/or what valuable information can you give me before going to see ""VAXXED""?

Edit: So I went to see the movie and most of it isn't about what you think. Rather it's about the CDC coverup of the study that showed correlation between autism and the MMR. It's actually really compelling on that front and I urge those of you to go and watch it for yourselves and then come back to discuss what you saw.

"My anti-vax aunt just posted this comment on an article, much more cogently argued than most posts I see, and since I'm not knowledgeable enough to specifically refute anything I was wondering if one of you were.",9,238hku,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/238hku/my_antivax_aunt_just_posted_this_comment_on_an/,22,1397700368.0,"She's a little bit of a conspiracy nut and is super into homeopathy, but she also has a Ph.D. and has written books, so the usual idiocy isn't on display (at least rhetorically). If everything she claims in this post is true, then vaccines are the devil. I know that's not the case, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to refute most of her points, so I was wondering if any of you were.

Here's the post:

""Contrary to the view that non-vaccinators are uneducated fools duped by conspiracy theories, most have taken the time to study the scientific data that show most vaccinations not to be worth the risk. Even the Supreme Court has deemed vaccination to be ""unavoidably unsafe"".
Are you aware that, by law, the CDC sponsors a vaccine injury database called VAERS -- the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. According to VAERS data, over the past 10 years alone, 26,793 people have been hospitalized with vaccine injuries and 2,081 have died. Did you know that 162 young people, mostly healthy teenage girls, have now died after receiving the HPV vaccine?
Did you know that, in exchange for granting legal immunity to vaccine manufacturers, the US government sponsors a vaccine court that awards compensation to families with vaccine-injured children? This court has paid out billions of dollars to families, including for children whose autism was deemed to have been caused by vaccination. Did you know that a 2005 FDA report on the Tripedia DTP vaccine listed many neurological problems as potential side effects, including autism?
Did you know that one of the key studies that supposedly exonerated vaccines from causing autism was authored by Poul Thorsen, now a fugitive wanted for money laundering and fraud? And that, in contrast to what is constantly repeated in the media, there are dozens of studies implicating vaccines as playing a role in causing autism, as well as many other neurological and chronic diseases, including Type 1 diabetes (also on the rise in children)? Did you know that a 2011 study in Germany that compared vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations found unvaccinated children to be far more healthy, with much lower rates of asthma, allergies, ear infections, epilepsy, gluten sensitivities, GERD, anxiety and depression, autism, and dyslexia?
Did you know that a growing number of physicians and immunologists are admitting that vaccination may not be worth the risk? They point out that, in an effort to avoid the childhood diseases (which only 60 years ago were considered beneficial because they triggered true immunity and spurts in child development), we may be causing an increase in chronic disease and a form of disease immunity that is not as strong and longlasting? Did you know that recent outbreaks of childhood diseases among vaccinated children is not due to their ""contamination"" by unvaccinated children or due to loss of so-called ""herd immunity"", but rather, is usually occurring in completely vaccinated populations because their artificial immunity is waning?
Please understand. Parents who wish to forego vaccination for their children are not asking that others follow their lead. They simply want to be permitted to follow their beliefs and not be forced to administer these drugs to their children. Indeed, many of these families already have a vaccine-injured child. Each year, the extremely powerful vaccine industry sponsors media campaigns (like the one we are currently experiencing) whose ultimately goal is to force everyone to become their customers. As a society, we must preserve our human right not to be forceably injected and medicated against our will.""",2014-04-17 02:06:08

Comment,0,gy44579,,0,1621008398.0,"YOU. ARE. DUMB. And part of the issue regarding people who don’t want the vaccine. It is forced. You have NO freedom if you aren’t vaccinated and what is this country supposed to be? FREE. Can’t go to work, shop, school, university, etc.... unless your vaccinated. Not everybody is able to do everything from home. You should not be told you can’t do ANYTHING unless you get the vaccine, especially when a vaccine is out that protects you from covid therefore putting nobody at risk. Holding something above our head like kids is wrong.

It’s MANDATORY if you want your freedom. And your “ScIeNce” and “BiDeN” and “FaUcI” few days ago was spewing bullshit about wearing masks and blah blah then yesterday, literally one day later, announced no more masks for vaccinated people with absolutely no new science, nothing changed. 

It has nothing to do with not trusting doctors or nurses or medical experts. It has everything to do with politics and the influence they hold over doctors/nurses and medical experts. They will do what Biden says and wants no matter what. They’ve completely contradicted themselves multiple times by taking back something they said cause Biden said opposite.

And BY THE WAY- the “ScIeNcE” SHOWS STATES THAT DUMPED THAT TRASH MANDATE OF MASKING... HAVE LESS OR FEWER contracted COVID CASES THAN STATES THAT DIDNT! LOL DUMBASS.",2021-05-14 16:06:38

No vaccine in use today has been used for hundreds of years (though that is probably a good thing)

Also I have already had my first dose

>then you A.) get a medical exemption, or B.) home school.

Medical exemptions are only if you have a documented contraindication, and homeschool is impossible for some people, so yes, requiring vaccines for school does in fact force people to take them, some states also require vaccines for homschool

Fever and body aches are symptoms from the innate immune system ramping up. 

But if your adaptive immune system (the kind of immunity you want from a vaccine) can take care of the antigens before they trigger an innate immune response, then those symptoms won't be as strong, if they're present at all.

Your immune system isn't *stronger,* *per se,* just you had already started developing the adaptive response and your sister relied more on an innate response. Two weeks after your second shots, you both should have comparable immunity to COVID. :)",2021-03-26 16:02:14

People have been working on AIDS for decades but retroviruses are particularly difficult to vaccinate against. We could create an effective flu vaccine if we were sure which of the many variants would appear in a given year.  At the moment current covid vaccines have moderate to great effectiveness against current strains but it is possible vaccines may need to be tweaked a bit if more resistant variants emerge.

A study published in 1998 - since discredited and withdrawn - associated the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with autism. But the concern it sparked among parents lives on.

“People didn't like that they were about to be injected with a biological product they didn't understand, and that was the birth of anti-vaccine movements,” Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC.

Experts say, there’s work to be done to ensure that happens. As distribution of the first 2.9 million doses kicks into gear, public health experts prepare to parse fact from fiction.

“There's a lot of work that has to be done to ensure that the vaccines that come forward that we trust in them, that we trusted the science was done right,” Besser said after months of whiplashed messaging -- and years of systemic inequality. “A casualty of that approach is trust.”

“I think it's okay to be scared,” ABC Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jen Ashton said. “It's okay to acknowledge that - it means you've been paying attention. But in medicine and science, we have to go on facts, not fear.”",2020-12-14 17:07:15

So, 0.063% of 2763 is 1.74.

Comment,1,fx0nt4p,,0,1593971742.0,"Hello. I am a nursing student displaced from clinical rotation due to Covid-19. I found your post regarding your concern relating to your child’s safety with updated vaccines. As you may know, vaccination is essential because it helps provide immunity before an individual is exposed to certain life-threatening diseases such as chickenpox or measles. There is a possibility that your child might get measles for an example, but very unlikely. According to the Mayo Clinic, more than 93% of people who get the first dose of MMR develop immunity to measles. After the second dose, about 97% of people are protected. The 2020 Recommended immunizations for children from birth through 6-years old from CDC are linked [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf). According to the CDC, “everyone six months and older should get the influenza (flu) vaccine every season.

The argument that there is a genetic component to autism is not by itself a proof that vaccines cause autism.

 Argument X:  ""It is also often argued that unvaccinated autistic people prove autism is not caused by vaccines""

I often argue the fact the people unvaccinated for MMR  get autism at  about the same rate as people vaccinated for MMR is good evidence that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.  The argument X above appears to be a misrepresentation of that argument by less intelligent people on reddit.

When vaccines are introduced, tests are done to see if they are safe.  They don't test for every single disease in the book.  In general, tests were not done for autism specifically in the distant past.

 Andrew Wakefield wrote a research article claiming the MMR might be associated with autism.  The article was analyzed and Wakefield was discredited and eventually lost his license.

At this point there was no reason to do further analysis scientifically on the subject.  There was no reason to think that the MMR vaccine caused autism.  Safety research on vaccines does not do analysis on every disease in the book.

However, with many vaccine opponents spreading false claims that MMR vaccine cause autism,  a large expensive research project was performed to show that MMR vaccine is not linked to autism.

  
There have not been large expensive research projects to prove every single vaccine does not cause autism.  There are also a thousand + other diseases we could study if there was money enough.  Similarly, tests could be done to see what correlations there are between every drug and food we take with every disease, but there is just not enough money for this.",2020-05-08 13:26:32

The fight to be ""first"" will be more important then waiting for the safest and most efficient vaccine (guess where the money is).

This also includes political willingness to say ""this is good enough, spread it"". 

So proper vaccine scientists warn that the temptation to approve **any** vaccine will probably be an issue.
Also, there are many new technologies being used for this vaccine, some of them never before used for vaccine development in humans.
There are a lot of unknowns, so experts are saying ""let the science be done, don't rush it""

This is a 36 subject study. It's too short and doesn't offer certainty. Either way, will discuss it again.


You missed this paragraph I guess, that the data is not showing a clear causation. 

> ""A second issue is that clearly not enough time has elapsed since the switch to aP to draw definitive conclusions about the resumption of cycles of B. pertussis incidence. While the data appear most consistent with asymptomatic transmission from aP vaccinated individuals, it may be many years before enough time has elapsed to be able to rule out this hypothesis.""


Also other disclaimers:

>Our model does not explicitly account for evolution of the B. pertussis bacterium [7, 56] — a factor which may play a large role in the epidemiological dynamics of B. pertussis. For example, it has been posited that B. pertussis has adapted to vaccination in several European countries. Mooi et al. (2001) identified genetic changes between pre- and post-vaccination strains of B. pertussis [8]. Despite this evidence, including evolution would merely increase the number of individuals susceptible to both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection and would yield exactly the opposite pattern of population genomic variation than seen empirically.



________________________________________________________________
The aP vaccine (acellular pertussis) is reliable for kids especially, somewhat similar to the rotaviral vaccine and maybe the meningococcal one too, because it offers immunity for a few  critical years, when kids are small and vulnerable. Unlike the whole cell pertussis vaccine, which gives a longer and sturdier immunity.

Nobody expects these vaccines to be efficient and create immunity per life. The same with tetanus and diphtheria. You have to get boosters to be actually protected for longer periods of time! Otherwise your antibody count will become super low and you become susceptible to the infection AND maybe becoming a carrier. Sure, not the case of tetanus, but the case of diphtheria. pertussis...

Why? Because with the aP vaccine, immunity is not stimulated enough, as there are less antigens in it to ""irritate"" the immune system and create enough antibodies. Hence you basically become unimmunized. Just like unvaccinated persons. 



This was observed in a trial for animals too. And by this, we get back to your previous ideas that unvaccinated kids are not that much of a danger. They are though, because they become even a bigger reservoir of infection.

>>""However, Merkel notes that there was a “startling” difference in acellular-vaccinated animals: “After they were infected, they became colonised and remained colonised longer than unvaccinated animals. Although they weren’t sick, they were carrying the bacterium in their airways.” When these animals were co-housed, they were able to infect other, unvaccinated, animals.

>>A similar pattern was seen with whole-cell vaccinated animals, but they were able to clear the infection within two weeks — much quicker than the acellular-vaccinated animals. “To a large extent, this can explain the increase we are seeing in cases of pertussis,” says Merkel.""

Either way, the conclusion was ok and mentioned that the more there are vaccinated, just like with polio, the less risk of contracting a disease if you have a large percentage of the population vaccinated. It's called herd immunity! And possible eradication. Look at polio, it still can be transmitted through feces, for a while after getting the vaccine. Yet in so many countries it's been eradicated.

Also, the problem is here that both the study you linked and the one I linked, failed to mention the antibody count. They're just mentioning waning immunity, which is not enough for a conclusion. 

This remains my point of argument, to what you said: you're not immunised,  or properly immunised anymore if you manage to colonise a bacteria you're vaccinated against. Aka: you need the booster.",2020-03-23 09:47:00

>In their study, Warfel et al. used non-human primates as a model for *B. pertussis* infection, and found evidence that **individuals vaccinated with current acellular** ***B. pertussis*** **vaccines (aP) can become asymptomatically infected, and can then transmit infection to susceptible individuals. The potential for this type of vaccine failure has been observed in humans where reanalyses of aP vaccine studies revealed that individuals vaccinated with components of the aP vaccine were protected against disease, but not bacterial colonization** \[[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/#CR10), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/#CR11)\].

>  
>Warfel et al. point out that asymptomatic infection in aP vaccinated individuals, and subsequent transmission, may partially account for the increase in observed *B. pertussis* incidence. However, from a public health perspective, the presence of vaccine-induced or naturally infected asymptomatic individuals who transmit disease could have consequences beyond facilitating an increase in incidence. In response to Warfel et al., Domenech de Cellès et al. (2014) \[[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/#CR15)\] argue that a reduction in incidence among unvaccinated individuals in a population with high aP coverage shows that aP must reduce *B. pertussis* transmission to some extent. It may be that aP vaccinated infected people are less efficient at transmitting *B. pertussis* compared with unvaccinated infected people, though it is not clear to what extent \[[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/#CR16)\].  
>  
>Here, we examine incidence and genetic data to provide empirical support for asymptomatic transmission and then construct mathematical models of *B. pertussis* transmission to explore the public health consequences of asymptomatic transmission. Our results suggest that: 1) there is strong empirical support for asymptomatic transmission from both the epidemiological and genomic data; 2) the presence of asymptomatic transmitters will bias estimates of vaccine efficacy derived from observations of stochastic fadeouts across cities; and 3) asymptomatic transmission provides the most parsimonious explanation for many of the observed patterns associated with current *B. pertussis* dynamics in the US and UK (that is, the resurgence of cases, the changes in age-specific attack rates, the observed level of bacterial genetic variation, and the failure of ring-vaccinating, or “cocooning”, unvaccinated infants).

Nope. That's not true. Healthy carriers can exist, but not for preventable diseases through vaccination. They can exist for staph aureus, for some strep spp. for example. But not the diseases someone is vaccinated against. There are literally no asymptomatic carriers, like there are in COVID-19.

Comment,7,fkxirg4,,0,1584629030.0,"1.) The movie they cited as their source, “Vaxxed”, was written by Andrew Wakefield. He is a former UK doctor who was hired by a group of parents to find a link between vaccines and autism. He published a study finding the link in the highly respected medical journal the “Lancet”. It was later found that he falsified the results of his study, and also performed very unethical and invasive tests on children with autism to “prove” his findings (think unnecessary spinal taps and other painful procedures). His was the first, and I believe only, article to be retracted in the Lancet in all its years of publication. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license and ability to continue practicing medicine in the UK. No doctors, in any country, have ever completed a study that replicated his results. An important factor of scientific studies is they need to be repeatable. If nobody else is getting the same results, his study is suspect regardless of the ethics of it (but that’s a huge deal anyways) I would be HIGHLY skeptical of anything that has his name on it.

2.) The movie Vaxxed is only showing one “side” of the story, if you can call it that. It’s meant to scare people and to convince them that vaccines are bad. It isn’t a sound source because it’s heavily biased and does not present all the information, only the information that supports their narrative.

3.) Vaccine injuries are a real thing. However, they are also incredibly rare. I am not a doctor, or medical professional in any capacity, so I don’t have hard science for you. But look at the number of people who have been fully vaccinated and compare that to the number of people who have vaccine caused injuries. My entire life, 99% of the people I know are fully vaccinated, and not a single one of them had any impairment attributed to vaccines. I’d do some research into the actual chances of vaccine injury. But I’m almost positive that the chances of a vaccine injury are significantly smaller than the chances of injury from other routine or necessary/life saving procedures that we don’t bat an eye at (think surgeries and the like)

4.) The hole in the logic of anti-Vaxxers that I’ve never heard them answer is this: if you break an arm, where are you going to go? Answer: the doctor’s. They wouldn’t think twice about it. I know anti-vaxxers who have rushed their children to the doctor for a high fever. However, they also claim big pharma is a conspiracy and trying to hurt you. If the vaccines aren’t safe, how can anything the doctor says/does be trusted? Either they are in on the conspiracy or they are dumb enough to be taken in by it, and either way how can you trust them? Also, the FDA approves the vaccines, and they also approve the other meds you might take/a doctor might prescribe you. How can you trust ANY of that if the vaccines are a huge conspiracy? You’re better off staying away entirely if that’s the case.

5.) The ingredients in vaccines sound scary, sure. I wouldn’t trust myself to mix a vaccine safely. However, I am not a doctor. I didn’t spend years studying medicine, and then following strict procedures and countless peer-reviewed and tested studies to have the know-how to make vaccines. Just like I wouldn’t trust myself to wire a house, because I have no experience, but I would trust an electrician. Or how I would trust a cardiologist to perform open heart surgery on me but I wouldn’t trust my husband because he isn’t a medical professional.

6.) On their whole “ingestion vs injection” thing; broccoli is totally safe to ingest. We recommend people ingestion broccoli as it’s very good for you. We do not recommend people injecting broccoli into their bloodstream. Again, I’m not a doctor, but injecting broccoli into your body will kill you. Should we get rid of broccoli?

7.) Vaccines seem unnecessary, but it’s because they work. Vaccines stop the spread of dangerous and even deadly diseases. When enough people vaccinate, it protects the vulnerable populations (elderly, very young, immunocompromised, and those who for one reason or another cannot receive vaccines). The disease cannot spread, causing it to effectively die out, or at least prevents it from becoming a pandemic. This whole Coronavirus thing is actually a good illustration of how bad a pandemic can be and how beneficial these vaccines are. Smallpox, measles, heck even the flu, all used to tear through communities and kill/injure a lot of people. Modern medicine helps, but the vaccines keep it from spreading like wildfire in the first place. When was the last measles epidemic? Or the last smallpox outbreak? We vaccinate for those, and while a case of measles or two might pop up every now and then, we aren’t shutting down cities because of an outbreak.

I hope this helps! Sorry for the novel, this is everything I’ve been wanting to say to my anti-Vaxxer friends and haven’t really been able to, so typing this up was kind of cathartic.",2020-03-19 14:43:50

As it stands, all routine vaccines for use in those under the age of 6 [do not contain thimerosal.](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines)

To be frank, if you're trying to convince your family, you're not going to be able to swim upstream against Facebook nonsense. Your best bet is to just say ""Thank you for your viewpoints,"" and go about vaccinating your kids based on the advice of an experienced pediatrician.",2020-02-23 23:32:25
Comment,2,fijm47t,,0,1582454473.0,"OK, Here goes for the second study, it is paywalled so I can't really see the whole thing but it says

>Boys vaccinated as neonates had threefold greater odds for autism diagnosis compared to boys never vaccinated or vaccinated after the first month of life.

This raises the possibility that some issue at birth is associated with both autism and postponement of vaccination, the including of 3 year olds who may not have been diagnosed yet, along with the use of ""parental report of autism diagnosis"" rather than medical record could also possibly create issues

This study was also done before mercury was removed from hepatitis B vaccine in the US, so besides the potential for confounding variables it is looking at a vaccine with a no longer used preservative (still used in certain flu shots, but not hepatitis vaccine). I don't think this is an entirely conclusive study

**STUDY #3:** This is comparing different countries, which is just asking for confounding variables, I'm not even sure I want to bother reading through a study that I can tell from the abstract is so inconclusive.

Also, the only author is  journalist who runs an antivax group

**STUDY #4** is a case report of an unusual event and is inconclusive because such case reports can't determine if the deaths were a coincidence or not

**STUDY #5** Is of an unsafe vaccine that was withdrawn from the market over safety concerns and has now been replaced with a different version [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rota.html#vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rota.html#vaccines)

**STUDY #6** Is just a temporal correlation, one of the weakest forms of evidence, and c an be used to draw all kind of ridiculous conclusions, examples here:[https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)

This study also uses number of pediatricians in a state as the measure of access to care, which is ridiculous, as finance, transportation, population, geography, ect also affect access to care

Also, the author is an economist, not a doctor

**STUDY #7** Just says a whistleblower said vaccines cause autism, a lot more info is needed to know what is going on here

**STUDY #8** is interesting but jumps to conclusions, as the info provided is insufficient to establish causation, it may be that an overactive immune system causes both the autoantibodies and the abnormal immune response to measles vaccine, rather than that the vaccines causes the autoantibodies. And if the vaccine does cause the autoantibodies, then measles itself likely also would, and may present a greater risk than the vaccine

**STUDY #9** is once again based on temporal correlation and comparison of different countries, see #6 and #3 for why that is bad

Comment,0,fijl0ok,,0,1582452969.0,"**TL:DR It takes time to read multiple studies, but I read though most of the first one and it looks pretty good, it suggests that around 1 in 168 kids have a side effect leading to an ER visit or hospitalization caused by the first dose of MMR and chickenpox vaccines, although most were just ER visits without hospitalization**

**I will look into the rest of them in coming days (or hours), but looking through all 39(!) will take some time**

Analysis of the first study (sorry it's so long, science is just complicated sometimes): The authors appear to be from legitimate institutions, and the methods of the study look legit, they found that among kids who go to the ER within 28 days after the 12 month vaccines in Ontario, more of them went to the ER between 4-12 days after vaccination than when to the ER on days 20-28, and this was statistically significant, using a legitimate definition of statistically significant (95% CI, and p-value <0.0001)

This suggests that that vaccines are causing kids to go to the ER between 4 and 12 days after vaccination, which is consistant with the expected timeframe for reactions to live vaccines such as the MMR and chickenpox vaccine, both of which are given at 12 months

The most obvious form of bias would be to compare time periods of different lengths, but they are comparing a 9 day period to a 9 day period, so no issue there

Another potential issue with a study like this study is that the rate of ER visits on days 20-28 is assumed to be non-vaccine related, and used as a control, so any vaccine related ER visits in this period would not only be missed but would contribute to a lower estimate of the number of day 4-12 ER visits that are attributable to vaccines, this bias would actually make the study underestimate the dangers of vaccines, but I don't know that it was a major issue based on the graphs provided

The fact that they vaccine related ER visits had almost the exact same severity score as the none vaccine related ones might suggest that the ""vaccine related"" ER visits and non vaccine related ones, are for the exact same conditions, meaning that none of them are actually vaccine related (or that they all are, but this wouldn't explain the ER visits right before vaccination). However, there was no increase in facial injuries in the period of increased ER visits after vaccination, suggesting that the increase was actually do to different conditions, ie, they were actually vaccine related. Vaccine related and non-vaccine related ER visits could be the same average severity if this is a threshold at which parents take kids to the ER, and both vaccine related and non vaccine related ER visits are rarely more serious than this threshold

The increase in ER visits after 18 month vaccinations (which include a second dose of MMR and chickenpox) was little to none, which is consistant with the fact that once you have had the 1 dose of a live virus vaccine you are usually vaccinated against side effects of subsequent doses, and this suggests that the increase in ER visits after the 12 months vaccines is either due to the live vaccines (MMR and/or chickenpox), or one of the non live vaccines that is given at 12 months but not at 18 months, although the timing 4-12 days after vaccination is more consistant with a live vaccine",2020-02-23 10:16:09

Comment,1,fgtleg0,,0,1581106046.0,"> Their immune system is burdened as well as purged of natural disease detourants.

I don't think there is any evidence for this, and I struggle to imagine any biologically plausible mechanism that would cause this. 

Vaccines are not especially burdensom to the immune system. On the contrary we encounter a dozen novel antigens per day, and at any given point our immune systems are in the process of combating 1000+ different insults (though the vast majority are mostly harmless like pet dander or pollen). 

Moreover, today's vaccination schedule is far less insulting than the one our parents went through. Today's children get more overall needle sticks, but smaller doses each time, and there are fewer novel antigens in said vaccines. In the 1960-70s they had no good way to determine which antigens to target to provoke an immune response, so they basically used brute force. Some vaccines had hundreds even thousands of antigens like the old Pertussis vaccine. Probably only a handful were relevant, but they couldn't isolate them, so they just gave you the whole load. Today we're much better at isolating the relevant ones. 

I saw a paper about this a few years back, IIRC a child born in the 2010s will be exposed to about 150 novel antigens through the CDC recommended vaccination schedule, a kid born in the 1980s probably got 3000, and in larger doses (but fewer shots). We probably get 20,000+ per year naturally anyway. As such, the insult from vaccinations is not that unusual, and in fact, far less significant than actually getting the flu or measles. I don't think there is any evidence that vaccination makes people ""softer"".

While hygiene theory suggest growing up in a sterile environment is a bad thing, there is no evidence that surviving horrible illnesses somehow makes you stronger. In fact, I'd wager the opposite. A serous measles infection for example, can royally screw with your immune system for years. 

As to your question, I can't imagine how getting routine flu and TDAP shots would make you more susceptible to something like SARS or nCov. 

I'd guess modern epidemics are the result of habitat destruction via industrial agriculture, and  reckless slaughter practices, and increased human mobility. The 2014 West Ebola outbreak was not unusual in any biological way, the only thing that changed was that modern Africa is surprisingly well connected with significant flow of goods and people, whereas 1970s Africa was isolated and most Ebola outbreaks were easily contained.",2020-02-07 20:07:26

What? How did you arrive at this conclusion? Zika was identified in the 1950s and is very similar to its flavivirus cousins (less dangerous than most). Avian flu (H5N1) is literally just one of many flu strains.

The first coronaviruses were identified in the 1960s, and are one of several that cause the common cold. You've almost certainly had a few coronavirus infections over the course of your life. SARS, MERS-CoV and the new nCov-2019 are unusually dangerous examples, but there is no evidence whatsoever that they were engineered.

I don't see how vaccines could have anything to do with these recent spillovers either. Putting domesticated food animals in close quarters with wild animals and humans is a receipe for disaster.

Different vaccine, different indications and schedules. Obviously insurance system will affect antenatal care and screenings, which affect the risk/benefit analysis for something like the Hep B vaccine (which, again, is not the same as the vaccine you're mentioning in the UK). It's just a different healthcare system. That there are different immunization schedules isn't particularly surprising or even necessarily meaningful.

>Aren't babies particularly sensitive when they are first borne?

The vaccine is tolerated fine, so I dunno what else this would imply that's worth addressing.

>I was thinking that it makes more sense not to give unneeded vaccines or medications on the first day of life just to improve compliance

It's not ""unneeded"" on day 1 any more than day 60 or day 600. You derive more benefit from earlier vaccination by definition. It also improves compliance because you already have started the schedule, informed the parents, and can test the mother. 

>although if there are testing errors I can understand this

That and screening insufficiencies, etc. 

>Why are you always so hostile?

Why are you always quick to make sweeping and uninformed judgments? I've just got no patience for such nonsense, and if you have any intellectual honesty then you'll grit your teeth, take the lumps where you've earned them, and be better for it.

Comment,9,fe5fvum,,0,1578868932.0,"> Honestly it is wired that they are giving this vaccine on day 1

To belabor the point that this is a pretty vapid comment:

>>Universal HepB vaccination of all infants beginning at birth provides a critical safeguard and prevents infection among infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers not identified prenatally (e.g., in situations where the mother was not tested or when testing, interpretation, or transcription errors occurred).

>>Approximately 88% of commercially insured women and 84% of Medicaid-enrolled women are tested for HBsAg during pregnancy (27). In one study of a large health system in northern California, 93% of HBsAg-positive pregnant women were tested for HBV DNA (28). Most (94.9%) infants born to infected women receive recommended prophylaxis within 12 hours of birth (29). 

>>Universal HepB vaccine birth dose coverage, defined as 1 dose of vaccine administered by 3 days of life, is 71.1% (30), an increase from 50.1% during 2003–2005 prior to revised ACIP recommendations for the birth dose before hospital discharge (31), but below the Healthy People 2020 target of 85% (32).

So we have [three good reasons](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm). First, through failure to identify Hep B positive mothers through two different mechanisms, and for compliance reasons (the baby *is* right there, after all).

Now the UK does it differently. They have both a different healthcare/insurance system, and they also use a hexavalent vaccine rather than monovalent Hep B vaccines. That's two levels of incongruent comparisons, and no particular substantive reason to delay other than if you support lower compliance rates and increased testing failure risks.

When citing studies, make sure they don't have major conflicts of interest ***IMPORTANT*** This is NOT the most up to date evidence of the flu vaccine's effectiveness, I only cited this as a source for the fact that industry-funded studies are biased. Here are more up to date reviews:

This isn't remotely in line with FDA approval standards. I also don't see how the Cochrane review in any way justifies your opinion here unless you misunderstand what 'bias' is meant in these reviews.

Edit: So I missed what you're likely referring to with this link, the warning at the bottom of this (and only this) Cochrane review. This review itself has no particular issue with or statement against industry funded studies and, of course, included many. The actual study you're trying to refer to is [this one](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b354) by another study author on these Cochrane reviews you've cited. Notably these reviews are in line with reported influenza vaccine efficacy which is common, that being ~45%. 

I've taken one example from the 2009 review you have meant to cite as an example (see Wongsurakiat 2004 in Table 2): 

>>Study was conducted over one year. Conclusions support recommendation of annual vaccination (one dose is sufficient in adults, as strong response has been observed). Authors note that vaccine effectiveness has been shown, even if it was possibly administered too late (in region where study was carried out peak incidence of influenza occurs usually in May).

All totally in line with their results. They have strong evidence of an effect even with a later administration. Seasonal homogeneity isn't uncommon, so this is a bizarre complaint against strong statistical results and completely 'concordant' summary in the conclusion. In fact, the delayed administration of the first dose still being effective is totally in line with rapid waning of influenza vaccine efficacy. Plus the patients had a second booster dose which is not normally recommended for adults, further maintaining higher titer levels into the next season. On a cynical reading, one might think that patients sick in May were included even though vaccination began in June. In reality, given the study was conducted for a full calendar year which simply rolled over a month after 'normal peak' season, this means that vaccination began in June of 1997, included May 1998 (peak season) and went through October 1998. 

>>Comment: though authors state that effectiveness is shown for influenza related ARI only, and not influenza, they recommend vaccination for patients with COPD. 

Because it demonstrated statistically significant reduction for influenza related ARI or, as referred to in the study, ILI. 

>>This means recommending vaccine though it is not effective against influenza and acute exacerbations. 

Misleading or incorrect wording. The Cochrane authors are distinguishing ILI and laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection (causing the pathology 'influenza'). As the original authors state, viral propagation from infection was only possible in 10% of those patients with ILI presentation. The paper does *not* demonstrate a *lack* of efficacy, but only *fails* to demonstrate *presence* of efficacy for lab confirmed influenza. Yet considering the serology confirmed increase in antibody titer, strong reduction in ILI, and lack of effect against non-influenza ARI, this is a terrible mischaracterization of the study and its conclusions. Usually there is no ability to distinguish between flu-ARI and non-flu-ARI. However in this case other viral agents were confirmed, giving much higher confidence in proper ILI designation. 

>>In addition, lack of comment on community viral circulation and vaccine content and matching make verification of effectiveness against ARI impossible.

I have no idea what the Cochrane authors are saying here. Wongsurakiat et al *do* comment on circulating virus among the community, *do* comment on vaccine content, and *do* make a matching verification. The predominantly circulating type A flu was H3N2 at the time, of which the vaccine component was stated to be on target, and of which the majority of confirmed flu in the study was confirmed to be type A. moreover, they confirm specific titer increases for the study subjects in line with well-known protective level thresholds. And, finally, the authors *don't* suggest the vaccine has effect against ARI--that is to say all acute respiratory infections--and instead say it is true for *only* influenza-ARI. 

This being a prime example in their table of discordance...I'm extremely disappointed. The Cochrane authors seem to dispute the sensitive nature of COPD patients to airway exacerbations and wholly ignore this supreme risk factor which any responsible clinician must weigh (risk) against perceived benefit of the vaccine (reward). See this excerpt:

>>All the unvaccinated patients with moderate-to-severe
COPD who were hospitalized because of influenzarelated ARI required mechanical ventilation. One of
these patients with severe COPD died because of
ventilator-associated pneumonia. In contrast, none
of the vaccinated patients required mechanical ventilatory support because of ARI related to influenza
virus infection.

Now, these results might not be statistically significant, but they aren't evidence of it being ""not effective against influenza and acute exacerbations"" like the Cochrane authors state. Are the Cochrane authors *really* disputing the idea that influenza vaccination proved effective against ILI? Or are they just harping on the lack of distinction between ILI and lab-confirmed influenza? Because one of those questions has an obvious and practical answer for clinicians, and the other is an academic or philosophical exercise.

Herd immunity does not and cannot exist due to vaccination. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/ea6kwr/comment/faoyld9

https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccinesCause/comments/dwacb7/the_myth_of_herd_immunity/

Pro vaccine choice individuals are the ones calling for more study and scientific progress. It is usually the ones that call for more vaccination that have the hubris to believe the science is settled and we know everything there is to know about the human body and the immune system.  

It is the ones against vaccine choice that have the arrogance to demand everyone follow what they believe regardless of the individuals hurt along the way. The belief that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and that the nation state should be allowed to tell an individual what to inject into their body are fascist ideals.

Fascism - anti-intellectual, anti-democratic, individual interests are subordinated to the good of the nation, forcibly suppresses opposition and criticism, regiments industry, commerce, etc., emphasizes an aggressive nationalism and often racism. 

AKA taking away an individual’s right to choose what is injected into their body despite numerous side effects and subjecting them to mass experimentation for “the good of the nation” while really just backing the ever growing pharmaceutical industry and suppressing any information that contradicts their interests. 

So even if you don’t agree don’t force your ideals on others. 

The nazis experimented on people. This led to the Nuremberg Trials and Code, detailing the human right for Informed Consent.
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199711133372006
Vaccine mandates violate an individual’s rights for informed consent.

They are experimenting on people with vaccines (ex: from vaccine insert: “vaccines have not been tested for mutagenic or carcinogenic effects on pregnant women” yet we give vaccines to pregnant women anyway. Also, activating maternal immune system has risks to fetus. Yet they persist in their unjustified claims that it provides some benefit.",2019-12-14 06:32:30

When it comes to live virus vaccines, the short answer is: Yes.
During a viral infection, live virus is shed in the body fluids of those who are infected for varying amounts of time and can be transmitted to others. 3 4 5 Vaccine strain live virus is also shed for varying amounts of time in the body fluids of vaccinated people and can be transmitted to others. 6 7 8
Although public health officials maintain that live attenuated virus vaccines rarely cause complications in the vaccinated person and that vaccine strain viral shedding rarely causes disease in close contacts of the recently vaccinated, it is important to be aware that vaccine strain live virus infection can sometimes cause serious complications in vaccinated persons and vaccine strain live viruses can be shed and transmitted to others with serious or even fatal consequences.”

Serious complications are not common, 1 in 300-500 chickenpox cases requires hospitalization and 1 in 60,000 results in death [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications)

>My kids are both fully vaccinated (4 and 2 years old), are they protected?

No guarantee, the vaccine is not 100% effective, and the second dose isn't given until age 4-6, so it is still best to keep your kids away from sick people until they are no longer sick. According to the CDC a person with chickenpox is no longer contagious 24 hours after that last new spot appears, which shouldn't be more than a week or so after the start of symptoms

>Arent your risk of getting shingles greatly increased if you have had the chicken pox?

Yes, it is pretty much impossible to get shingles if you haven't had chickenpox or a chickenpox vaccine

>I am pregnant but had them as a kid, am i protected?

This is probably a question for your doctor, but there is no guarantee, and live vaccines such as chickenpox aren't recommended for pregnant women, so avoid exposure to infected people especially while pregnant, as harm to the fetus is possible [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications)

>If anti vaxxers get excited that your body builds natural immunity after having the disease, isnt that what vaccines do for your body except your never ""sick""?

Yes, (well you can still get a little sick) but antivaxers are concerned about combinations of viruses in one vaccine, multiple vaccines at the same them, and chemical additives (although most of the chemical additives of concern are only used for vaccines against things that you can't build up immunity to from catching them)",2019-11-25 20:19:32
Comment,2,f8q5w5h,,0,1574712610.0,"So I’ll answer this as best I can, I am neither a doctor or an anti-vaxxer so anyone feel free to correct me/add on if I’m wrong:

The mom is excited about her kids getting chicken pox because basically once you’ve had chicken pox you’re unlikely (or immune, not 100% sure which) to get it again. Before the chicken pox vaccine it was common to try to get your kids exposed to chicken pox young because I believe the older you are the worse it is. So basically she’s trying to prevent her kids from getting it worse by exposing them young. Which would make sense except we have a vaccine so they never have to get it at all.

The point of vaccines isn’t just to protect you. It protects immunocompromised people who will her can’t get the vaccine, or can but are otherwise at risk of getting sick anyways. Two of my siblings are on immunosuppressants for other conditions they have. Despite being fully vaccinated, they get sick super easy and when they get sick it’s way worse because their immune systems are shot. So, like I said before, before the vaccine it made sense to expose your kids young to head off a worse infection later. Now, however, there’s no need to encourage the spread of a disease that could be dangerous for certain people groups (immunocompromised, elderly, young children, pregnant women, etc.).

The whole “natural immunity” thing that anti-vaxxers like to tout is not really what they make it sound like. They like to say your body is naturally able to fight off infection/keep you from getting sick. Which is true, to an extent, but when your kid gets chicken pox they don’t have a “natural immunity” to chicken pox. They still got chicken pox. It’s not like your body miraculously protects you from ever getting sick.

If you are concerned about your own health, I’d talk to your doctor. Since you are pregnant you can get sick easier. My personal, NOT MEDICAL, recommendation would be to stay away from your friend/her kids/her husband/etc until the chicken pox completely clears their house. Again, ask your doctor what they recommend, but I think steering clear is the safest bet here since you DON’T want chicken pox and pregnancy at the same time. That sounds terrible! Also remember that just because someone is not showing symptoms does not mean they aren’t carrying the disease. I’m not 100% sure how chicken pox spreads, so again please please talk to your doctor, but if your friend isn’t sick she may still be able to spread the disease to you.

As far as shingles goes, I think maybe having chicken pox as a kid makes you more likely to get it but I don’t think you have to have had chicken pox to get it. Again, not 100% sure here so hopefully someone smarter is able to fill this in!

Hope this helps!",2019-11-25 20:10:10

Of course low efficacy doesn’t make them more harmful. But it does change the risk benefit analysis. 

Of course not all ILI are flu. Only about 3% - 9% of suspected flu cases are actually flu. The flu vaccine is less effective because as you admit “strains cannot be matched every single year. Of course that a virus with increased mutagenic shifts will not be matched for the vaccine every year.” So all the ILI are used to promote flu vaccines but vaccines may reduce 10-30% of 3-9% of “flu” cases. And these number are before factoring in primary and secondary vaccine failure and declining efficacy through repeat vaccination... that’s a low benefit. 

Plus you are now exposed to the risks of vaccines. Autoimmune diseases, GBS, etc

Pregnant women shouldn’t be vaccinated. There being no studies on vaccine safety doesn’t make them any safer. But it does allow officials the ability to claim there is no proof vaccines are harmful... convenient. 

From vaccine insert: “vaccines have not been tested for mutagenic or carcinogenic effects on pregnant women” yet we give vaccines to pregnant women anyway. Also, activating maternal immune system has risks to fetus. Yet they persist in their unjustified claims that it provides some benefit.

It’s interesting you mention “Spanish Flu” because some actually believe it was the vaccines of the time, exacerbated with aspirin, that caused the deaths. It’s an interesting theory that could explain a lot of the anomalies observed. 
http://whale.to/vaccine/sf1.html

Um, no.  What they said was there was a correlation found they just don’t know why the efficacy is lower after repeated vaccination and more study was needed. 

I have smart amazing unvaccinated children. Thank you for asking. 

Vaccine side effects are not rare. They are suppressed. There is a difference. 

Vaccines are labeled “unavoidably unsafe” by the US Supreme Court and were protected from judicial oversight through legal channels (National Child Vaccine Injury Act in 1986), this took away legal channels for discovery and safety review. This happened because so many people said vaccines were injuring their loved ones.

The population at large is told adverse reactions are rare and not to worry about them. So Drs and patients alike do not know the risks and do not see a connection between their health issues and the vaccines they’ve received. (The majority of vaccine recipients are too young to tell us if they are experiencing side effects). If no one is looking at or tracking the risks then how can you say they’ve got a safe track record. We are not healthier overall and without a definitive cause for the health concerns it is irresponsible to say definitively that vaccines are not the cause.

Vaccine adverse events 1) compensated in vaccine court: Guillain-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, encephalopathy, seizure disorder, death, brachial neuritis, acute disseminated encephalomylites, Chronic inflammatory demyelination, polyradiculoneuropathy (CIPD), premature ovarian failure, Bell’s palsy, juvenile diabetes, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, infantile spasms, anaphylaxis, ocular myasthenia gravis, hypoxic seizure.

2) listed on vaccine inserts: Autoimmune diseases, allergies, asthma, eczema, tics, Tourette’s syndrome, ADD / ADHD, autism, speech delay, neurodevelopment disorder, SIDS, narcolepsy.

When an automated reporting system analyzed data reported over a 3 yr period it found that adverse reactions could be 26:1,000 or approximately 1 in 38.

http://healthimpactnews.com/2017/harvard-immunologist-to-legislators-unvaccinated-children-pose-zero-risk-to-anyone/ “A recent study done in Ontario, Canada, established that vaccination actually leads to an emergency room visit for 1 in 168 children following their 12-month vaccination appointment and for 1 in 730 children following their 18-month vaccination appointment (see appendix for a scientific study, Item #5).”

1 in 640 have a seizure from mmr https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles/vrs/

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmrv/mmrv-febrile-seizures.html
“The rate of seizures in this timeframe was 85 per 1000 person-years in the MMRV vaccine group compared to 42 per 1000 in the MMR and varicella vaccine group. This risk was about 2 times higher in children who received the combination shot (MMRV) versus the single shots (MMR and varicella).”

“Approximately 40 cases of death and permanent injury from the MMR vaccine are reported to VAERS annually” and only about 1-10% of adverse events are reported. So that could mean approximately 400-4000 deaths or permanent injuries from the mmr vaccine annually.

“As of March 31, 2018, there have been more than 89,355 reports of measles vaccine reactions, hospitalizations, injuries and deaths following measles vaccinations made to the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), including 445 related deaths, 6,196 hospitalizations, and 1,657 related disabilities. Over 60% of those adverse events occurred in children three years old and under.” https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles/vrs/

After automating adverse event reports at Harvard Pilgrim, the developers of this system asked the CDC to take the final step of linking VAERS with the Harvard Pilgrim system so that these reports could be automatically transmitted into VAERS. Instead, the CDC refused to cooperate. As the Harvard grant recipients explained: Unfortunately, there was never an opportunity to perform system performance assessments because the necessary CDC contacts were no longer available and the CDC consultants responsible for receiving data were no longer responsive to our multiple requests to proceed with testing and evaluation. After three years and spending $1 million of taxpayers’ money, the CDC refused to even communicate with the HHS’ Harvard Medical School grant recipients. While HHS generally strongly supports automating public health surveillance systems, when it comes to vaccine safety, the CDC has only supported projects that would limit VAERS to passive surveillance. Automation would improve safety and address many of the long-standing issues and limitations raised by CDC regarding VAERS.37 Capturing “fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events” thirty years after the passage of the 1986 Act is unacceptable – and potentially deadly. https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/whitepapers/VaccineSafety-Version-1.0-October-2-2017.pdf",2019-11-19 01:56:12

The metaanalysis puts all flu and ILI in one pot, so it's irrelevant. Not all ILI are flu and not all flu are deadly. It doesn't mean 

1: **AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccines are efficacious in preventing cases of influenza in children older than two years of age, but little evidence is available for children younger than two years of age.**


No studies on this, doesn't make it less efficient. 

2: **There was a difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, partly due to differing datasets, settings and viral circulation patterns.**

Oh no, who would've thought, you moron, that strains cannot be matched every single year. Of course that a virus with increased mutagenic shifts will not be matched for the vaccine every year. Nobody claimed anything different. That doesn't make the vaccine itself harmful. What the fuck are you on about? Are you doing meth?

As a former epidemiologist, I'm ashamed to read  Jefferson T's  ""review"" about the influenza vaccine. He uses SO FUCKING MANY fallacies. He doesn't take into account even the morbidity or mortality of the flu and claims that not even pregnant women should be vaccinated, because the less you do medical acts on them, the better. That's outrageous and bizarre as fuck. Do we live in 2019 or 1900?

Do you even fucking know how flu pandemics wiped millions of people in 1919? Just look up Spanish flu.

I'm sure those people would rather get a low antibody count from a vaccine, than fucking none. 40% less deaths is better than what happened then.

You said that the flu shot is less and less efficient if you get it every year.

Again, your reading comprehension is out of this world. And that's not good. Cause you don't seem to be having a human brain.

They said:

""Researchers found adults had similar levels of protection if they received the flu vaccine in the current season, the previous season or both seasons. They also found that vaccine effectiveness was 27-41 percent higher for adults who were vaccinated for the first time in the past five years, compared to those who got the vaccine almost every year. She said reasons for the increase in effectiveness is not yet clear and more research is needed to understand how repeated flu vaccination affects the immune system.""

You know what that means, mister scientific method? That means THAT NO CORRELATION WAS FOUND.

SO WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING HARD PROOF, WHERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE? 


I really hope you don't reproduce and just so you know, logical fallacies don't confirm your bullshit. Yes, science evolves. But vaccines are proof that science also works and it's better to prevent, unlike your claims that drs don't want that, than to treat. Or bury your patients.

Scientific progress always takes a long time. Even the now simple concept of hand washing took more than 20 years to catch on and Dr. Semmelweis was mocked and shamed for the notion that Drs may be spreading disease, suffered a nervous breakdown and died due to mistreatment in an asylum. This is how we reward people who question the status quo and seek progress, especially when it may bring to light that Drs may be unwittingly harming patients by following that status quo. 

Pro vaccine choice individuals are the ones calling for more study and scientific progress. It is usually the ones that call for more vaccination that have the hubris to believe the science is settled and we know everything there is to know about the human body and the immune system.  

It is the ones against vaccine choice that have the arrogance to demand everyone follow what they believe regardless of the individuals hurt along the way. The belief that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and that the nation state should be allowed to tell an individual what to inject into their body are fascist ideals.

Fascism - anti-intellectual, anti-democratic, individual interests are subordinated to the good of the nation, forcibly suppresses opposition and criticism, regiments industry, commerce, etc., emphasizes an aggressive nationalism and often racism.

As far as group immunity...
Note the “no decline in transmission” below 

According to a Cochrane review the flu vaccine IF it has the correct strains circulating reduces the likelihood of catching the flu from 4% if unvaccinated to 1% if vaccinated. A 3% risk difference. So not much of a benefit there. Also the study concluded that there is no evidence that the flu vaccine affect complications, such as pneumonia, or transmission. The CDC combines pneumonia rates with flu rates to estimate the number of deaths from the flu, creating extremely exaggerated numbers to push the flu vaccine when the flu vaccine doesn’t reduce rates of pneumonia. And the insert actually lists pneumonia as a possible side effect.

And...

The Myth of Herd Immunity
The Myth of Herd Immunity leads us to believe that unvaccinated populations will bring back epidemics of deadly diseases. This myth also makes us believe that:
1. Unvaccinated children are a threat to society and
2. Unvaccinated children pose a risk to vaccinated children.
I’ll tackle this whole discombobulated mess of a myth in one post, through the research, knowledge, science, & expertise of a doctor, a pediatrician, & a neurosurgeon.
What are we told?
* We often hear statements from public health officials like “Clusters of unvaccinated children are not only in potential danger themselves, but are also a threat to the herd immunity”.
* Authorities argue that parents should vaccinate their children to protect society as a whole from epidemics.
* According to public health officials, “parents who reject vaccines don’t consider the effect of their child on the rest of society”.
* We are told that for the shots to work, everyone must play along. And parents who decline the vaccines, are somehow reaping the benefits from those who are vaccinated.
What is truth? 
Dr. O’Shea, in his book: “Vaccination is Not Immunization” explains:  “Do not make the error of many pediatricians or journalists who talk about herd immunity as though it refers to the immunity that proceeds from a large group of people being vaccinated. The calculated deception behind this common misnomer is that if you don’t know what herd immunity is, you’ll buy their illusion: that the unvaccinated child can take advantage of the herd who have been vaccinated. This is well though-out propaganda. True herd immunity is a term which indicates that a disease has burned itself out within a population, as with plague, smallpox, typhus-every infectious disease in history. The herd has become immune. Natural selection. It has to do with nature, not with manmade vaccines. Don’t be fooled again”
Dr. Palevsky (board-certified pediatrician) explains: “This whole concept of herd immunity is very interesting, because we were taught that herd immunity occurs because a certain percentage of a population gets an active illness. Therefore by a certain percentage of getting the active illness, they impart a protection onto the remaining part of the population that has not gotten the illness yet. And so the herd that is getting the illness is shedding the illness and protecting those who have not gotten it.""
In vaccine science, we are extrapolating or concluding that if we vaccinate a certain percentage of people, we are imparting protection on those who have not been vaccinated. And that has NOT been shown to be true, because the true herd immunity in theory is based on an ACTIVE DISEASE, and we know that despite what we’re taught, vaccination does not mimic the natural disease.
Thus, we cannot use the same model of herd immunity in a natural disease in the vaccination policy. This does not stop the press, every single year.
The entire concept of herd immunity fails to acknowledge that there is a life cycle of the viruses and the bacteria all on their own, and that what turns them on and off may have nothing to do with the percentage of people who have been infected.
By failing to include that viruses have a life cycle, and that they are in relationship to other organisms and to us, we are missing the main point. It is preposterous to think that a child who is vaccinated no longer carries the bacteria or the viruses that they have been vaccinated against. That is the whole point of vaccines.
So Once You Are Vaccinated, You Are Part of the Herd. Right?
Dr. Blaylock (board certified neurosurgeon) explains: 
“In the original description of herd immunity, the protection to the population at large occurred only if people contracted the infections naturally. The reason is that naturally acquired immunity lasts for a lifetime. Vaccine proponents quickly latched onto this concept and applied it to vaccine-induced immunity. But there was one major problem: Vaccine-induced immunity lasts for only a relatively short period…
This is why they quietly began to suggest  boosters for most vaccines, even the common childhood infections such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella.
Then they discovered an even greater problem: The boosters were lasting for only two years or less. This is why we are now seeing mandates that youth entering colleges have multiple vaccines, even those that they insisted gave lifelong immunity, such as the MMR. The same is being suggested for full-grown adults. Ironically, no one in the media or medical field is asking what is going on. They just accept that it must be done.
That vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. We all were told for over 70 years that vaccine immunity lasts a lifetime. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given.
What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. At least 50 percent of the population has been unprotected for decades.
If we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95 percent. Yet we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50 percent or less of the population having vaccine protection.
Herd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades, and no resurgent epidemics have occurred. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinations”.
Where is the Logic?
Take Pertussis (whooping cough) Dr. Palevsky explains this very well:
Do children vaccinated with the pertussis vaccine somehow stop carrying pertussis bacteria in their airways simply because they’ve been vaccinated? NO
Do pertussis vaccines stop vaccinated children from transmitting the pertussis bacteria to other people? NO
Do pertussis bacteria disappear from society once vaccination rates are high? NO: Vaccination rates for pertussis have no impact on whether the pertussis bacteria are in the air or not, or whether or not we breathe them in. The presence of the pertussis bacteria, and the exposure to them, are in no way affected by vaccination status or vaccination rates.
Do unvaccinated children, because they are unvaccinated, carry the bacteria in their airways, which vaccinated children are somehow no longer believed to be carrying because they’ve been vaccinated? NO
Do unvaccinated children transmit the pertussis bacteria to other children by the mere fact that they are not vaccinated? NO: Air is air. Air is free to breathe. We breathe in whatever is in the air. And, vaccinated and unvaccinated children are equally exposed to breathing in pertussis bacteria.
Anyone who poses as science the idea that unvaccinated children pose a threat to the population because they are unvaccinated and are more likely to transmit a disease to the rest of the population, is misleading you, promulgating myth, and inaccurate. Vaccination with the pertussis vaccine does not exonerate anyone from carrying the pertussis bacteria, or prevent them from being exposed to the bacteria.
Unvaccinated children do not walk around carrying secret viruses and bacteria that no-one else has. An unvaccinated child with measles has no greater chance of spreading measles than a vaccinated child with measles would.",2019-11-16 17:19:18

“Researchers found adults had similar levels of protection if they received the flu vaccine in the current season, the previous season or both seasons. They also found that vaccine effectiveness was 27-41 percent higher for adults who were vaccinated for the first time in the past five years, compared to those who got the vaccine almost every year.

Comment,2,f72cx84,,0,1573358926.0,"Every company manufacturing vaccines has been charged and convicted of lying to the public about the safety of its products. 

Vaccines are labeled “unavoidably unsafe” by the US Supreme Court and were protected from judicial oversight through legal channels (National Child Vaccine Injury Act in 1986), this took away legal channels for discovery and safety review. This happened because so many people said vaccines were injuring their loved ones.

The ethical argument against double-blind placebo controlled studies is nonsense. In drug trial (vs biologics aka vaccines) a sick individual would be denied a drug that could potentially save their life in order to have a true control to determine an accurate basis of side effects for risk assessment. And in vaccine trials they will not only use a different vaccine as the “placebo”, they will also use a solution with the aluminum adjuvants in place of a saline solution. How is this beneficial to anyone? How is it more ethical to expose someone to the most questionable ingredient in the vaccine with no benefit of generating any kind of antibodies? It’s total nonsense. 

Aluminum does cross the blood brain barrier and accumulate in the body. 

The study “Flarend et al.”  was a study of 6 rabbits over 28 days that looked at the absorption and elimination of Al adjuvants. 

The study admits we do not understand Al adjuvants in the body. “The disposition of aluminum containing adjuvants after intramuscular administration is not understood.”

The study detected Al adjuvant in the brain, kidneys, spleen, liver, lymph nodes and heart.

Most of Al still in the system after 28 days: “The cumulative amount of aluminum eliminated in the urine during the 28 days of the study was 6% of the Al hydroxide and 22% of the Al phosphate adjuvant dose. Aluminum from both adjuvants was still being excreted at a steady rate at day 28.”

For Al hydroxide, about 100-5.6% = 94.4% of the aluminum remained in the rabbits after 28 days. For Al phosphate, about 100-22% = 78% remained in the rabbits after 28 days. We do not know the elimination rates of the Al still in the body after 28 days or what happened to the Al that travelled to the brain and other organs. 

Al and macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) lesion
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318414/
“We previously showed that poorly biodegradable aluminum-coated particles injected into muscle are promptly phagocytosed in muscle and the draining lymph nodes, and can disseminate within phagocytic cells throughout the body and slowly accumulate in brain. This strongly suggests that long-term adjuvant biopersistence within phagocytic cells is a prerequisite for slow brain translocation and delayed neurotoxicity”

Science vs pseudoscience

Scientific progress always takes a long time. And it is ever evolving. Even the now simple concept of hand washing took more than 20 years to catch on and Dr. Semmelweis was mocked and shamed for the notion that Drs may be spreading disease, suffered a nervous breakdown and died due to mistreatment in an asylum. This is how we reward people who question the status quo and seek progress, especially when it may bring to light that Drs may be unwittingly harming patients by following that status quo.

using double blind, inert-placebo, randomized studies is the gold standard in science for a good reason.
there is only one way u can get around using such safety studies, which is the use of a prior tested medication or vaccine in a double blind, randomized, inert-placebo controlled study, so that the safety of this medication has been proven prior properly, to be used as a control group in an non inferiority type of study, this however was never the case for any vaccine.
and i don't care what a WHO expert panel says, the WHO being a huge part of the pro vaccine push, despite refusal to do proper studies, so why should i listen to an appeal to authority, to an agency, that literally throws oil in the fire of fear of people against people, who are educated and refuse to vaccinate.
and i literally linked 2 sources in the last comment, that showed u, that aluminium in vaccines is an acute exposure.
""An aluminium adjuvant in a vaccine is an acute exposure to aluminium""
and i linked u a 2nd source showing, that extreme levels of aluminium are found in the brains of autistic people:
""aluminium in brain tissue in autism""
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763
so i assume u haven't even read them?
question: if we find the neurotoxin aluminium in the brains of autistic people, where does it come from according to u? could it be, that vaccines are the source? oh wait it is the highest source for it looking at the first paper doing some basic math, the first infanrix hexa vaccination being 3x the load of aluminium to the 56 day old baby, as they got their whole entire prior 55 days of life through breastfeeding, the math is clear, the science is clear.
Doesn't cross the brain's barrier, doesn't accumulate, doesn't do... whatever you and the others claim today.
skeptical raptor calls it pseudoscience, yet we got a clear delivery way and source and we find it in the brain at extreme levels, so it CLEARLY crosses the blood brain barrier, how about u read the sources i give, before u state your believe of the opposite?

Example for the rotavirus vaccine

>A key ethical aspect considered when adopting the placebo-controlled design was that the risks of withholding rotavirus vaccine could be (and were) mitigated by rehydration counselling and regular check-ups. 


Another problem with that is that these vaccines were proven over and over again that they are effective. And there are multiple methods to do that without risking someone's lives. Like testing for antibodies. It's simple, it's effective, it doesn't cost that much, especially not a life!

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4157320/

>Against this backdrop, the WHO Department of Ethics and Social Determinants convened an expert consultation to provide recommendations on the use of placebo controls in vaccine trials in cases where an efficacious vaccine already exists. 

See? It's not like the dropped the vaccines on the market and then let them do damage and hope for the best. The vaccines were extensively tested anyway, so yeah, now maybe they can have some placebo tests done, if it doesn't risk... let's say, an infant's life. But they don't even need to do that. They just have to use an unvaccinated cohort (and they can find that for sure, either because of poverty, lack of vaccines, etc) and compare the results.

>While this paper focuses specifically on the use of placebo controls, similar considerations apply to open designs in which a placebo is not used, but an unvaccinated control group is included.

For the other thing: https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/aluminum-and-vaccines-its-time-to-clear-up-the-pseudoscience/

First it was ""mercury"" or thimerosal, which is a salt of mercury. Now it's aluminium. They're just moving goal posts. 

The dose makes the poison. From a 0,5 ml dose of a vaccine, aluminium will not be in such a high quantity and it will be eliminated from the body within 72 h and wouldn't be able to travel anywhere, since it's injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly. 

In fact, it stays there, irritates the skin, draws white blood cells to it and then will help create a higher immune response than a vaccine without it. That's it.

Comment,1,f6njdph,,0,1572992793.0,"It's funny that. In England & Wales from 1901 to 1970 sudden and inexplicable deaths in under 4 year old's was a rarity with just a few cases per year. In 1961 the first measles vaccine was trialed here. 1961 saw a higher than ever reported morbidity of measles and a higher than average mortality, the 5 years prior to this we weren't even seeing 100 deaths per year which was quite the achievement given at the start of the century we were seeing up to >13,000 in a year, in 1961 we saw 152 deaths. 1962 they seemed to step back. No reports of any tests and the numbers showed it. Case rates plummeted, as did mortality. 1963, they officially star to use the first measles vaccine. Again, we see morbidity and mortality rise:

Year	Cases	Deaths

1956	160,556	    28

1957	633,678	    94

1958	259,308	    49

1959	539,524	    98

1960	159,364	    31

**1965	502,209	   115**

**1966	343,642	    80**

**1967	460,407	    99**

If you look at the history of measles mortality, you see a pattern develop - low then high. Over the decades, mortality bombed. No NHS, no antibiotics, no vaccine, just improved living and better understanding. When you look at 1956 to 1960 and compare that to how the drop was constant up until this point, there was nothing in nature that should have allowed mortality to rise the way it did, the **only** difference during these times was the measles vaccine. Mortality was almost double what it should have been during these times.

In 1968 an *improved* vaccine is released and measles rates settle. Uptake is slow, however, the interesting thing is the rise in sudden and inexplicable deaths in children under the age of 4 from 1970. Prior to 1970, there were 2, maybe 3 if any deaths in under 4's which couldn't be explained.

**Sudden and unexplained deaths in under 4's:**

**1961 -** 0

**1962 -** 0

**1963 -** 0

**1964 -** 1

**1965 -** 1

Yes. Have you considered the possibility the dose in vaccines can make the poison in some individuals? Both aluminum and thimerosal are acknowledged as neurotoxins.

Read on:

>  Dr. Verstraeten “…we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes. First, for two months of age, an unspecified developmental delay, which has its own specific ICD9 code. Exposure at three months of age, Tics. Exposure at six months of age, an attention deficit disorder. Exposure at one, three and six months of age, language and speech delays which are two separate ICD9 codes. Exposures at one, three and six months of age, the entire category of neurodevelopmental delays, which includes all of these plus a number of other disorders.”

> Dr. Weil, pg. 207: ""The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant. The positive relationships are those that one might expect from the Faroe Islands studies. They are also related to those data we do have on experimental animal data and similar to the neurodevelopmental tox data on other substances, so that I think you can't accept that this is out of the ordinary. It isn't out of the ordinary.""",2019-10-30 11:09:30

Comment,1,f5sddg1,,0,1572424099.0,"**Ethylmercury**

Ethylmercury (sometimes ethyl mercury) is a cation composed of an organic CH3CH2- species (an ethyl group) bound to a mercury(II) centre, making it a type of organometallic cation, and giving it a chemical formula is C2H5Hg+. It is one of the metabolites of thiomersal (thimerosal or sodium ethyl mercuric thiosalicylate), which is used as a preservative in some vaccines. The term ""ethylmercury"" is also sometimes used as a generic term to describe organomercury compounds which include the ethylmercury functional group, such as ethylmercury chloride and ethylmercury urea.

>I am saying that just because most people don't have autism doesn't tell you about what causes autism, only changes, or lack thereof, in the number of people with autism can tell you this

You originally said that OP claimed a rate of ASD independent of change or what not was enough to determine if vaccines had any effect on ASD. OP never claimed this, and you never explained why one might presuppose a static rate of ASD was reasonable to begin with.

And *that* was what I was trying to tell you. ASD rates have changed independent of vaccines. You cannot look at one point in time and conclude anything. You insisting that OP said that is bad faith, since there is nothing to indicate that's what they meant, you never asked them about it, and there are plenty of reasonable interpretations on the table.

[This site](https://vaxopedia.org/2018/05/19/does-the-cdc-own-any-patents-on-vaccines/) is useful for viewing this assertion in context. Just a quick recap:

The CDC buys a lot of vaccines from manufacturers for distribution. Aside from perhaps a few extraordinary and obscure experimental vaccines, the CDC does not mass-manufacture vaccines.

The CDC does hold patents; more specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services holds these patents. Most of these technologies involve the vaccine *technology,* and ostensibly allow the government to control intellectual property such that what researchers have developed on the public dollar don't end up being capitalized by industry, where the price would get marked up.

They didn't link fluoride to reduced IQ in children, they found that doses higher than drinking water (and slightly above EATING toothpaste, which it's clear not to) can act as a teratogen and damage the child during a pregnancy. 

Since your post asks about Mercury, I'll explain that a little more. Elemental mercury isn't the same as organic mercury. If your only chemistry background was in high school or not even then, it's understandable that you may not fully understand this. 

Methanol, HOCH3, is extremely poisonous to humans on low doses. Ethanol, HO(CH3)2, so off by just a saturated carbon, is drinking alcohol. Not safe, but not poisonous at moderate doses. That's just a couple atoms. 

A better example might even be oxygen. Breathing in the oxygen you do, diatomic oxygen, O2, is MUCH different than elemental or ionic oxygen. One let's you live, the other rips apart DNA. That's just a couple electrons. 

The best example, as always, is table salt. Sodium in it's elemental,uncharged, +0 state explodes in reaction with water. Chlorine in it's elemental, uncharged form is an incredibly poisonous gas. But guess what? When these are combined, or for specificty's sake, one electron is removed from each, they become a flavorful, harmless salt. That's one electron that separates an explosive sodium with a dissolvable sodium ion. 

In that same spirit, the mercury that used to be in vaccines wasn't in elemental form. It was in this compound.
 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Thiomersal.svg/1200px-Thiomersal.svg.png

That looks pretty complex, right? The way molecules are structured doesn't allow for atoms to ""be themselves"" when in a compound. Mercury here (in it's +2 state) can't do what we all know elemental mercury, or even worse, methylmercury, can do. It can't just break free and be a dangerous atom. The resonance forms from the ring as well as the heavy metal salt component make it a completely unique compound; not just the sum of its parts. It's much more complex than that.

>The occurrence of encephalopathy after whole-cell pertussis vaccination has been an issue of intense scrutiny and debate. Often cited are the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study conducted in UK from 1976 to 1979 and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report (1994). The initial findings of the National Encephalopathy study were that acute encephalopathy occurred at a rate of 1 per 310,000 to 5,300,000 doses (95% CI 54,000 to 5,310,000). Subsequent investigations and follow-up of the affected children then cast some doubt on these initial findings and demonstrated no increase in the rate of death or other sequelae after a DTwP vaccine (Edwards et al., 2008). However, despite these revised findings this has been an area of ongoing controversy. In 1994, the IOM concluded that “the balance of evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between DTwP and chronic nervous system dysfunction in children whose serious acute neurological illness occurred within 7 days of a DTwP vaccination”. This may imply that the vaccine rarely may trigger such an event in an individual who may be predisposed to develop such a condition because of an underlying abnormality. The IOM committee concluded that the evidence is insufficient to indicate either the presence or absence of a causal relationship between DTwP vaccine and permanent neurological damage (Cowan et al.,1993). More recent studies do not confirm an association between DTwP and acute encephalopathy. A population-based case-control study has evaluated the association between serious acute neurological illness and receipt of whole-cell pertussis vaccine, given as diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTwP) vaccine. The estimated odds ratio for children with encephalopathy or complicated seizures was 3.6 (95% CI, 0.8 to 15.2). The study concluded that there was no statistically significant increased risk of serious acute neurological illness in the 7 days after DTwP vaccine exposure (Gale et al., 1994). A retrospective case-control study performed at four health maintenance organizations by examining children aged 0 to 6 years who were hospitalized with encephalopathy or related conditions determined that cases were no more likely than controls to have received a DTwP vaccine during the 90 days before disease onset. When encephalopathy of known etiology was excluded, the odds ratio for case children having received DTP within 7 days before onset of disease was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.45-3.31, P = 0.693) compared with control children. The study concluded that DTwP vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of encephalopathy (Ray et al., 2006).",2019-09-16 02:11:34

Also, okay, it's like... maybe stop causing autism and we'll take your vaccines.. but why can't you let us investigate it and fix it? Oh that's right, because we might find out you've lied over and over and over, covered up soo much data, ignored so many scientists, discredited respectable information and studies..

Oh and also, we want to keep the population trusting in our products and keep our delusion that we are doing a great job to humanity!!

Comment,-4,etdqzqj,,0,1562713070.0,"1) Autism is not ***just***... genetic, it's a behavioural diagnostic term for anything that leads to its criteria, such as brain damage, gut health, biology etc.. Or, genetic abnormalities. Or, environment.

It's a biomedical, neuropsychiatric, and environmental disorder.

Summary)

Well, many many scientists believe vaccines aren't safe, and believe there's alot of crap going on in the realm of vaccination and in the medical community and the media community.

You know why there aren't many scientists who are against vaccines? Well, because when they are, they get fired, and awesome now we don't have to call them scientists any more.

If you retract all the science against vaccines, well no shit, the science is bare and not there..

But that's because you only let science that agrees with your BELIEFS stay on the map.",2019-07-09 22:57:50

Comment,1,esgwb7g,,0,1561970303.0,">We're talking about cancer which has a direct relationship with age. The greater that lifespan is the more prone we will be to cancer as we exceed previous lifespan limitations. That's just how genetics and DNA work. As you age your DNA becomes more damaged, when it becomes more damaged it will be more error prone. The more error prone the more likely cancerous mutations are to develop. Unless we can find a way of fundamentally changing our DNA and how it operates that's just the way the cookie crumbles as we age. 

Thanks for explaining what cancer is.. I I'm having a difficult time working out what points you think you made here.

Cancer doesn't just come from ageing, you clearly have no idea what cancer is. Many children have cancer.

>Autism was just an example to show that statistics can be misleading without given proper context i'm not going to go into whatever that nonsense of a last statement was.

And how does this example demonstrate that it's misleading?

Autism rates are massively correlated with vaccination rates, in different countries, where health, food, living conditions, and hygiene are the same.",2019-07-01 08:38:23
Comment,1,esfyuxg,,0,1561938530.0,">autism has increased greatly in the past couple decades” well yeah no shit because now we understand it better and are able to identify and address it better than they could more than 40-50 years ago.

But not only autism; encephalopathy, meningitis, brain damage, SIDS, chronic illnesses, autoimmune disorders, diabetes, and organ failures, especially in kids, have also drastically risen.

to credit the entire growth of 50 fold to mere diagnosis and understanding is pretty shoddy

>It is more cancer though, technically, since more people are able to live longer there’s going to be more people with cancer - which increases rate of cancer in a population. So someone can skew some statistics and say “vaccines lead to a higher percentage of people with cancer” or “vaccines lead to a higher chance of cancer” which is true, albeit an out of context statement, because people live longer = more older people with cancer = higher cancerous population = higher chance of becoming cancerous.

I guess nothing can rise anymore, because it all just comes down to more people living..

so no, the number of cell phones is not rising, it's just the amount of people that can be alive to have them increase due to living longer and better with cell phones.",2019-06-30 23:48:50

Yes, Taiwan and China. Both prior to vaccine campaigns and after unadjuvanted vaccination, respectively. And by ""handful"" exactly how many cases are you suggesting happened in Europe following Pandemrix vaccination compared with China/Taiwan? You keep using spin despite your apparent disdain for it.

>No cases in Europe like that. They were all associated with the vaccine, not the virus.

Only Pandemrix, and there is no current hypothesis in which the vaccine was a risk factor *outside of* viral antigen (not specific to the vaccine) or other concurrent environmental factors (e.g. H1N1 infection, GAS).

>About 1300 cases. All vaccine, no virus.

That's not even remotely true. You're literally just bullshitting:

>> [A biologic mechanism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30122647) to explain this observation has not been established, but it has been postulated that an interaction involving the immune responses to administration of Pandemrix-AS03 and infection with wild-type pH1N1 virus could be a contributing factor [20]. This would explain the apparent presence of an association in Finland, Sweden and Norway where wildtype virus circulated coincident with the vaccination program, whereas no association was seen in Ontario where wild-type virus was no longer circulating at the time of the vaccination program.

You also are greatly exaggerating the numbers of those with NT1 narcolepsy relative to the overall risk. It really isn't known exactly how and why some people who received Pandemrix even with the associated HLA did or did not develop narcolepsy. Over 11 million doses have been distributed total.

>Funny how genetics works, isn't it.

Comment,3,emf7fqr,,0,1556901956.0,">No more AS03 being used in Europe right now, though, is there?

Well, duh, it's an experimental adjuvant that isn't used in any vaccine excepting emergent circumstances and clinical trials. It's also not used in the US, either, because there isn't a need for it. It's just used for pandemic vaccines in emergent circumstances.

>You can spin it how you want. An interplay of vaccine and genetics really screwed these people.

There's no spin, just fact. But since you live and breathe off spin and lies, I'm not surprised you recognize a different consistency here. You've gone waaay off the beaten path because you don't know shit about immunology, ASD pathogenesis, or infectious disease. So you found that one discontinued vaccine increased the risk of narcolepsy/cataplexy in a subset of genetically disposed individuals and you're trying to run hard with it.

It has nothing to do with childhood vaccines, nothing to do with ASD, and likely nothing to do with AS03. That there was an association with the vaccine is incidental and due to the fact that it was, apparently, able to recapitulate the natural tendency of some circulating pandemic 2009 H1N1 strains to increase rates of narcolepsy/cataplexy. To repeat: **circulating H1N1 virus was correlated with increased narcolepys/cataplexy rates prior to vaccine campaigns in several countries**.

Cryptic antigen mimicry which is the presumed mechanism of action is likely at play in several diseases. If we can determine the B or T cell epitopes with cross reactivity these can be removed from the vaccine. As it currently stands, these epitopes were never determined. Nevertheless, you will still run to such edge cases with relatively small impacts on small incidence rates because this is how you behave when you've been cornered. You repeat this pattern over and over, much to the amusement of onlookers. 

>Maybe you should go back to playing with next year's flu vax formulation.

Comment,4,emeuiyr,,0,1556893689.0,">Yawn.

In your sleep deprivation it seems you completely forgot your operating hypothesis: differences in ethnicity ultimately lead to a differential ASD diagnostic outcome.

Congratulations! We have [data](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/addm-community-report/differences-in-children.html) on that. It doesn't support your hypothesis--that non-white ethnicities have higher ASD diagnosis. So we keep piling up the implausibility. You have to now plausibly explain why higher antibody titers or other unknown immune response factors to a vaccine lead to differential ASD diagnosis among races. And *then* you have to explain why in *your* link there is no difference among genders--which is a hallmark for differential ASD diagnosis. Oops, guess ya didn't read that after all.

So, yes, I'm curious: how would race, but not gender, impact ASD development according to the above link when this 1) doesn't fit epi data on ASD diagnosis among ethnicities; 2) doesn't fit gender epi data on ASD diagnosis? But we know the answer: you haven't thought about it and you don't care. You just bring up some random hair-brained idea to deal with your cognitive dissonance. The pattern has borne itself out twice in this thread alone.

>I'm ""caucasian"". I've also found out I have fairly recent genetic ties to subsaharan Africa.

Excellent--so this would *not* be a problem with the Danish study, as genetic factors can be cryptic and not adequately accounted for by simple race-binning. High five!

>That was a pretty big fuckup too, wasn't it? One in five europeans carrying a dormant gene for narcolepsy that the vaccine adjuvant just happened to trigger?

Uh oh, sounds like you don't know much about AS03, MF59, or the Pandemrix situation and that this is just a random distraction from the actual conversation you've so thoroughly lost. No worries--I'm used to having to fill you in on everything.

The Pandemrix association with narcolepsy appears to be a cryptic antigen site, not related to any of the adjuvants used in the pandemic vaccines. Read the [multi-country](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6404226/) assessment which looked at several AS03 and one MF59 vaccine, as well as the safety assessment of [AS03](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19305225?via%3Dihub). 

Also, you don't seem to understand how genes work. The vaccine didn't trigger a ""dormant gene"". The virus, which the vaccine recapitulated specific antigenic sites, can apparently trigger autoimmune reaction in a small subset of people among a specific HLA type. I recommend hitting up wikipedia on [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene) so you can get that under your belt. 

You're lucky I grade on a curve, bucko. See, OP? He don't know anything. Recognize the signs and you can spot 'em a mile away, as well as the usual tactics that fall flat.",2019-05-03 14:28:09

That's a hilarious assertion.

>So we have a study comprised of children all most likely of a single ethnic/racial background (white and northern European) with no racial/ethnic diversity considered whatsoever.

The diversity is representative of the Danish population. So you concede there is no cause for concern among the Danish population. Excellent. Now we just need to walk you from this bizarre racial angle.

If you think race is a better predictor of autism risk factors than sex, smoking during pregnancy, family history of ASD diagnosis, head circumference at birth, weight at birth, method of birth delivery, and, vaccination status...then yous an idiot. 

But you don't *really* think that, it's just the convenient way you try to remedy your cognitive dissonance. We get it. 

>We can draw NO universal conclusions from this study.

Not even your own logic supports this ridiculous claim. In the most conservative interpretation, even if we assume your hypothesis about race to have *some* merit, we can now rule out all medical, non-race, factors from influencing ASD development in association with vaccines. And by extension based on the Danish population we can confidently declare that anyone of caucasion descent also has no differential response, either.

The relapses are caused by the stress the vaccines/attenuated virus causes on the body. Relapses get triggered from stressful events anyways so it makes absolute sense that a vaccine would also do this.

concerned about the future,5,pgxvvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgxvvh/concerned_about_the_future/,5,1630642719.0,"I never thought the pandemic would get to this point. I have has CLOSE friends shame and ridicule me for not getting vaccinated. One even said that if I died it would be “natural selection”. I was shocked and appalled! Mind you, I have an autoimmune disease so even if I wanted to be vaccinated, I am at higher risk for a bad reaction. I can’t even sue anyone if something were to happen to me and I’m the one that would have to live with adverse effects. 

These people just want to feel superior. They think that because they eat up everything the government is feeding they are somehow better. Its ironic bc you can still spread the virus if you’re vaccinated! & let’s be real, you don’t care about saving anyone’s life if you are wishing death on those who question what’s going in their bodies. Whatever happened to asking questions? Anytime I go to eat anything I’ll read the label. The vaccine isn’t any different. We should be allowed to be skeptical and want more information. 

I then saw Candace Owens be denied a covid test because she “spreads misinformation”. If we are going to be denying medical attention for spreading misinformation than every obese “body positive” person should be denied care when they get diabetes and heart disease. Based on this logic we should also neglect those who smoke and drink, those who hurt children or anyone who does anything you don’t agree with. That is NOT how healthcare works & if this is the way you think then you should not be in the medical field. 

Even though I am set in my choice of not getting the vaccine, I am still scared. I do not want to be sick, I don’t want to die from the virus either! The media is doing a fantastic job at fear mongering the masses. One day it’s a mandated vaccine, the next all your rights are taken away. Whatever happened to our right to choose, our rights to speech and simple conversation? We are now so divided! This would we are living in is scary. Praying for our future",2021-09-03 04:18:39

I am seeking help from this sub, because it is one of the last places on the internet that most any legal topic can be openly discussed. 

As a virologist and biosafety professional, I found last year that this was the only place I could read about and discuss the likelihood of the lab
leak of COVID-19, and was eventually removed as a moderator of /r/covid_19support because of posts I made on /r/coronavirus discussing the likelihood of the lab origin of this pandemic. I am looking for more examples of the benefit to our public discourse from allowing freedom of speech on this and other platforms. Also, I am trying to highlight that the type of discourse that is possible on Reddit is a good mechanism for building trust and credibility during public health crises. 

Could you suggest specific posts to your subreddit that highlight the importance of free speech to productive public discourse? Also, could you suggest other subreddits that I should look into? 

An example of the kind of issues in favor of free speech I’d like to highlight is the suppression of discussions of the lab leak hypothesis illustrating how over-moderation of subreddits such as /r/coronavirus have hurt the ability of the public to understand relevant considerations related to this pandemic, especially regarding the need for policy changes about the governance of high consequence research moving forward.  Others include the suppression of discussions of the utility of masking (including N95/KN95) and spreading misinformation about mask effectiveness to protect the supply chain, especially early In the pandemic. I would really appreciate any insights, as These issues are critical to educating the next generation of policy professionals to be ready for the challenges in this new world.

I’m pretty much on the all about profit bandwagon myself, but I’m wondering how many people would agree a few very powerful wealthy men may have engineered this crisis just to keep Epstein and Ghislaine out of the news. If Epstein had a dead man switch of videos of Gates and Clinton’s and Rothchilds interfering with children surely they found it before killing him. I think the only reason Ghislaine is still in jail is because they know she has her own deadman switch and until they figure it out she’s to be kept under lock and key.

It’s a brutal idea I know, the virus and vax only being a secondary part of a larger conspiracy but to me the fundamental corruption of these people have only ever been alluded to, no proof, or nothing ever stuck. They’d be desperate to keep the public interest anywhere but on her. 

They released Epstein’s flight logs, but what about other people flying their own planes in? 

They sacrificed Prince Andrew but that somehow turned into a Press release from the queen more or less staying it wasn’t so bad because the girls never where under the age of 14. Perhaps in the case of the prince this was true, for all the others? Probably not. Either way sheep just heard and believed that all the girl were young woman, not children, and the queen is okay with it so I can be to.

They threw Gates under the bus as well, more or less making him a villain and a hero in the eyes of the public in a few short months.

Who so scary they can do this these kind of people? 

I think there should be a permanent thread stuck to the top of this sub titled Epstein and Ghislaine, like what the fuck?

_______________________________________
At the beginning of the pandemic it seemed as if the United States was mobilizing for war. 

Trains were seen leaving the Port of Los Angeles loaded down with tanks, and other armored vehicles.

Cheyenne Mountain bunker went into full lockdown.

A million and a half national guard members were called back into active service.

Military members from different branches leaked communication at the beginning of the pandemic indicating that this would be taking place for the next 4 to 18 months. I specifically remember seeing a few texts or text communication conversations posted to here on conspiracy, where service members were assuring their family and friends that things would be okay but it might be a while first.

There's been so much hyperbolic and bombastic media happening since then that it's been hard to get any more of a bead on what's really going down.

One of the constant threads that's been bandied about here on the subreddit has been the idea that a lot of this war is taking place in deep underground military bases, or DUMBs.

Another thread that's been consistent in conspiracy theory circles for decades has been the manipulation and control of weather.

Grabbing a couple of different tin foil hats and forming them together in one gigantic tin foil helmet, I'm now going to hypothesize that weather has been effectively weaponized, and is being currently used to flood deep underground military bases.

Flooding has taken place in China, turkey, germany, Saudi arabia, the United states, russia. 

There have definitely been other major flooding events happening around the world, but these are the names and territories that seem to dominate in the news.

Several of these events include full submersion to street level of subway systems.

It has long been hypothesized that subway systems are typically the entrance, or hold the entrances, to many of these deep underground military bases.

If you were wondering if your operatives are okay in a certain location and contact has been lost, seeing a photo in the major media of a location with the entrance of your base completely flooded is a certain message, whether it's a middle finger or a solemn nod. 

One of the other interesting things that leads me to believe there's something strange going on underground was a recent story of an area of ground around 5 acres square that suddenly and immediately sank down around 20 ft from the surrounding landscape. It's such a specific shape, depth, and size that it seems suspicious. If there was an underground complex of that shape and size that just happened to get collapsed, that's likely exactly what would happen on the surface.

If anyone else has any thoughts on this, feel free to leave them below. This is labeled as a hypothesis because this is just armchair thinking, with no real evidence or directed research into these phenomena.

&#x200B;

You may, or may not (it depends), be a part of an exciting social conditioning in which they want you to doubt everything you read.

&#x200B;

That sounds like a good thing.

That sounds like a smart thing to do - doubt everything you read and see with your eyes, no?

&#x200B;

Well, maybe it is but, I want to bring up the question that they (they: meaning government agents, institutional pawns/provocateurs, etc) want you to be suspicious of everyhing to the point that you can no longer tell what is honest information being brought forth by the average person, and info that is being fed to you by, as listed above, provocateurs, etc, etc.

&#x200B;

Paranoia iis a natural emotion that many experience in which they feel like they are being mislead, watched, targeted, lied to, etc, etc, etc.

It's healthy and natural to feel a bit of paranoia --- How?

&#x200B;

Picture thusly: you check into a hotel, a B'n'B, Air B'nD, etc, - what's one of the first things that may cross your mind? ""Is there a camera in this room?""

&#x200B;

Is it wrong to question the possibility of a camera watching you in this case? - No.

Why? Because it's reasonable and it has happened to many, many people.

&#x200B;

So what's wrong with paranoia?

&#x200B;

Paranoia becomes an issue when you can no longer tell lies, from truths.

&#x200B;

That's what certain groups probably want.

&#x200B;

Who is telling you what they believe to be true, and who is telling you lies, either on purpose, or unintentionally?

&#x200B;

Learn to be able to smell bullshit, don't question yourself, but don't doubt yourself.

You'll create your own rabbit hole if you doubt and doubt and doubt, to the point that you can no longer trust anything you see, hear, or read.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The important part in all this is that you trust your own intuition - whether or not you feel like you can trust anything - you can trust yourself to be able to sense what may or may not be true.",2021-09-03 01:55:50

He was caught and JSTOR demanded the return of the articles and a promise not to redistribute them etc.  Aaron agreed and JSTOR was satisfied and did not want to prosecute saying they suffered no damages or losses, which should have been the end of the issue.  

Except the Massachusetts US Attorney’s office decided to file a case themselves against Aaron with a laundry list of hacking crime accusations that would have amounted to 35 years in prison and a 1 million dollar fine, which is basically ridiculous.  Murderers get less time!  HOwever many felt Aaron could have won that case by arguing his actions did not constitute a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act because JSTOR allowed people to download journal articles anyway, Aaron had only breached the TOS by downloading more than allowed.  A breach of TOS does not automatically constitute a crime.  Article about that story here: [https://www.rt.com/news/aaron-swartz-suicide-reddit-858/](https://www.rt.com/news/aaron-swartz-suicide-reddit-858/)

Also the coarse of two diseases could be similar - first infection results in minor symptoms and after that there is a silent period of no symptoms which results in most  cases  with aids or prolonged covid. Your immune system is compromised and weak therefore variety of different health problems occur. Covid attacks and destroy T cells just like Hiv. Covid is often asymptomatic just like hiv. For hiv it takes sometimes 10 years for first symptoms to appear. Covid could be the same because majority of people think they didnt have it yet.

Vaccine for covid is actually vaccine for hiv. Proof of that could be moderna suddenly developing covid vaccine based on same mrna technology

Viral load is the term used to describe the amount of HIV (covid) in your blood. The more HIV (covid) there is in your blood (and therefore the higher your viral load), then the faster your CD4 cell count will fall, and the greater your risk of becoming ill because of HIV (covid)

Covid attacks and destroy T cells just like Hiv.

 Vaccine will help compromised immune system (for those who already had covid) to fight the disease by lowering viral load.Vaccine could protect those who didnt have covid by lowering the number of active viruses upon entering body and therefore minimising chances of developing infection in the first place.

The glowing tatto they plan to introduce is actually similar to a experiment with Fiv(feline version of hiv) with a gene of jellyfish that causes a jellyfish to glow in the dark.When inserted in feline cell it causes feline cell to also glow in the dark.  

 While investigating feline ""H""iv scientists discovered that gene found in macaque monkeys is capable of protecting cats from hiv. With gene editing they were able to get felines cells incorporated with mentioned monkey gene. But scientist couldnt know which  cells of the gene edited felines has monkey gene in it and which doesnt. To solve that problem before inserting gene in felines they ""linked"" monkey gene with glowing jellyfish gene   that in return made gene edited cells in feline to glow. Becsuse they were glowing scientist could observe exactly wich cell is altered and which is not and how cells with monkey gene fight hiv.

So thats why at place of injection of vaccine people will have glowing mark (tattoo). Will they mark cells with jelly fish gene or in some way with luciferin is unknown.

In the future majority of people will have prolonged covid and suffer from all other diseases caused by compromised immune system. They will be unable to lead life without vaccine booster

"all land is no ones property ... or ... giving every human being alive free acess to a fair share of fertile soil, taxfree, rentfree as a lifelong lease",0,pgv3cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgv3cx/all_land_is_no_ones_property_or_giving_every/,13,1630632105.0,"acess to land is the most basic foundation for a life what is free from any social dependance  
the single human being who builds its own shelter from clay it has dug out from the very ground, mixed with stones it has collected from the near riverbed, sticks it has found on the floor of the near forests  
the single human being who grows its own vegan foodstuff  
the single human being who weaves its own clothes in the winter from the outer parts of the hemp stalks what were dancing in the wind all summer long in front of ones own house one has built with ones own hands  
land can never be declared property of a single human being or even be regarded from a moral ethical perspective as belonging to this or that group of human beings whatever fancy names human beings would give such groups, communities, nations, federations ...  
all land belongs to mother earth, she is the owner of her body  
if we human beings want to follow what makes sense reflected from a moral ethical angle ... we would adopt a humble approach towards our future relationship to land  
not only is equal acess to some land for every human being a goal to consider but also us human beings leaving as much as possible space for wild animals and unregulated plant growth could be the single most sucessfull action we could go for when thinking in terms of ... allowing mother earth to recover from all the poisoning we did to her during the last 200 years of industrialisation, so much toxic garbage we introduced into her waterways, nuclear radioactive waste, toxic chemicals, plastics en masse and now this wretched plastic masks ...  
i believe that no one human being has any moral ethical ground to demand from an other human being to do this or that in order to be able to get acess to the very earth we all live upon  
it is plain wrong of the human community to demand of a single human being to pay for the ability to acess land to build a house on it,  
to grow food on it, to grow plants on it,  
to weave ones own clothes from  
how would anyone be entitled to sell another one acess to land what is not anyones property  
the conclusion of this fundamental thoughts seems to be that a fair and just structure for human society would be one where every human being would receive at the moment of its birth some space reserved onto its name ...  
the local community, the people who live here and now in this area, welcoming the newborn human being with presenting it the guarantee that a decent amount of land would be reserved in its name  
so that whenever the newborn would want to use it, wether its at age 3, 8 or 12 ... whenever the single human being would want to start training itself building its own shelter, planting carrots, potatotoes, cabbages etc. for itself ... the local community would show the young one this space what would be reserved for the single member of the community to be used as long as one lives, without any taxes asked or any rental demands tied to the use of that land  
and after the single member of the community has exhaled its last breath, the land would return again into the stewardship of the local community, the ( full ) assembly of all children, youth and adults, each permanent resident acknowledging each others same weighted political voting power  
today, in switzerland about 10 000 million square meters of fertile land is being used for grazing and growing of crops, this land could be calculated into monetary equation ... trying to evade the word ... ""worth"" here as it is a ridiculous concept ... but to stick with the argumentation .... an amount of 100 billion swiss francs could be attributed towards this amount of land used for agriculture today  
about 13 100 million square meters of forests in switzerland could samewise be attributed with a sum of 30 billion swiss francs  
the 5 million voting eligible swiss citizens could if they wanted, have acess to about 300 billion swiss francs of public wealth what is today owned by the 26 cantons, the regional states what together build the confederatio helvetica, the swiss nation state  
these 300 billion swiss francs of public wealth are allocated towards the 26 cantonal states via alltogether 55 percent of shares of the swiss national bank over which the cantons have control  
the conclusion of these numbers could be ... with less than half of the public wealth, the 5 million voting eligible swiss citizens could offer a decent price to every owner of agricultural land and forest  
and then the land what the private owners would be willing to sell towards the good cause, the prosperity of all,  
the land released from private ownership would then be transferred under the stewardship of the more than 2000 local communities, the villages, towns, city-districts of switzerland which from this moment onwards would allocate a thousand square meters for each single permanent resident  
of course such a communalisation of land could be done via todays still existing legal tools such as the people initiative ... the ability of swiss citizens to form an initiative comitee with 8 members what would dedicate themselves to gather 100 000 signatures from their fellow 5 million voting eligible swiss citizens  
to demand a public vote  
wether or not  
the 55 percent shares of the swiss national bank owned by the 26 cantonal states should be sold and the proceeds from the sale be invested to buy as much open land and forest what swiss private owners would be willing to sell, with the released land than transferred into the stewardship of the more than 2000 local communities which again would dedicate this then communalised land to be kept as long as possible in public stewardship  
or ... and i prefer this variation ...  
the very basic structure of the swiss nation state and its building cantonal states ... the constitutions of states ... would receive a renewal to enable the local community be its own fully absolute political sovereign  
possibly using concepts such as:  
\----  
the local community is its own absolute political sovereign  
it inherits all political decision powers from both the regional and the nationals state  
the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the full law, all rules what are valid on its territory  
all children, youth and adult permanent residents acknowledge each others same weighted political voting power and invited each other to participate in all decision finding processes  
all local sovereign communities receive a fair share of all financial and material wealth of both the regional and the national state, the size of the share in proportion to the numbers of permanent residents of a village/town/city-district  
every local sovereign community at all times without condition is able to exit/quit/leave both the regional and the nation state  
\----  
the advantage of such a radical dissolving of all political hierarchies would be that in such a future of the local community being its own absolute political sovereign ... that each one of the more than 2000 villages, towns, cities in switzerland could decide its very own pace how to do exactly what with that inheritance of the abdicated regional and nation state  
very well possible to think that some of the cities would not be interested to buy land or forest but more like would want to invest into communal housing, appartement 5 story high buildings or skyscrapers newly built and or bought of private owners at a fair price so that every city resident alive today who would want to ... could ask to live in such a city owned appartement without having to pay rent  
also possible to imagine how indoor food production via aeroponic and hydropnic grow systems in the very living rooms of city appartements, bioreactors growing microalgae such as spirulina and chlorella, funghi growth containers stacked on top of each others, vertical farms etc. could allow cities to become self sufficient in their food production and thisway allow vast areas of the swiss landscape to be possibly given to wildlife  
land what today is being used to graze enslaved cows and goats and sheeps in the mountain parts of switzerland ... could possibly given back to wildlife   
and yet another decentralised approach of some villages and or citiies could be ... to dedicate their world saving or more appropriatly expressed .... to better the chances for humanity to remain an activly participating species on earths biosphere ...   
for example by attempting to invite as many as possible of the 80 million human beings who are today asking for a safe space as refuge  
people who have fled from their birth places because war and economic instability, extreme poverty made their stay in their homelands impossible  
at 1000 m2 given to everyone living in switzerland today as a taxfree, free from rental demands lifelong lease  
with today 8.4 million people living in switzerland  
and 10 000 million square meters of fertile soil  
there is a potential for 10 million beings to live in switzerland from the land  
not one drop of fossil fuel imports needed, not one kilowatt hour of electricity required, no cars, tractors, no aeroplanes, no tv or radio stations, no cell phone towers ... no machines no noise no chemical industrial pollution  
just 8.4 million people living in switzerland inviting another 1.6 million refugees to come and join the simple good life  
10 million people voluntarily choosing to not use any machine but only the most simple tools such as shovels, saws, earthen pots .... houses built with bare hands, carrots and potatoes planted and harvested with hands digging into the earth, clothes woven on self built wooden looms",2021-09-03 01:21:45

is Cultural Diversity Compatible with Instilling Ethics and Values in the Youth?,0,pgukq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgukq2/is_cultural_diversity_compatible_with_instilling/,3,1630630123.0,"If you study any natural science or humanistic discipline that studies people, you'll see that there are principles that govern the vitality and health of groups. Whether we are talking about cultures or races, there are certain patterns and regularities that can be used to predict the survival and longevity of a people.

So when we look at America today, it is frightening (or should be) that we are incapable of:

1. discussing the importance of instilling cultural values in the youth
2. appreciating the fact that people have diverse origins

&#x200B;

Just because there are many cultures, doesn't mean that they are all equally good at surviving. Almost everything sounds good on paper, but sometimes depending on where you are at, other ways of organizing a society will seem excessive or unreasonable - just because of the distance it has from what is presently tolerated.

For example, is Sharia Law (like that practiced in Afghanistan) bad for women? Well, today's feminism is not particularly good for women who on average are depressed and heavily medicated. Pressuring all women to compete with men seems excessive from a historical perspective, where this was never necessary and women never needed to prove themselves as competitive and power-hungry as men in order to be respected and supported in society. Sure some women want to compete in the NFL or be CEOs, but that doesn't mean that there are no differences between women and men.

From a conservative perspective, I can't imagine anything more reasonable than for women to wear burkas or to present themselves modestly in public. Fashion in America is often geared towards being sexually available and aligns well with promiscuous sexual ethics. But why is it that Americans are so averse to sexual modesty? Why wouldn't a conservative woman find strength in not showing her hair to any man besides her husband? It seems like America's cultural values have vanished since the 1950's. It shouldn't be the case, though, as black Americans are also capable of holding socially conservative opinions. But the media seems to push youth culture towards seeing rebellion as a value. It is as if hating your parents, culture and nation is a right of passage for America's youth - hardly a healthy way to preserve a society or to compete with other nations.

Why in today's world is China able to ban what they perceive to be western media's creation of sissy, feminized men, but America cannot have an honest discussion about masculinity without saying that all men who use power to get laid are toxic?

Somehow we are to believe that masculinity is toxic AND that women should be like men. Women should take pride in killing babies cause it is an expression of femininity and bodily autonomy is what we learn in colleges today. We learn that women should be proud to have as many sexual partners as possible, because there is nothing special about virginity or sex. We are taught that innocence is creepy and that sexual promiscuity is somehow 'toppling the patriarchy'

People of the world. This is the mother of all truth bombs, so take heed of this warning.

On November 4 2021, Illuminati criminals [not Muslims! ] are going to crash cargo planes loaded with nuclear bombs in six major cities: Washington, California, London, New York, Rome and Paris. The major landmarks in those cities like, the Golden Gate bridge, Big Ben, the Statue of Liberty, the Colosseum, the Vatican, and the Eiffel tower will be destroyed. In the case of New York, a nuke will be detonated in the east coast, and it will cause a tsunami to overwhelm the city !

This will be a mega false flag event like the world has never seen before. ISIS will take responsibility but it will be a huge LIE. This plot has been on the NWO agenda for at least 50 years. This will be THE event that will give rise to the NWO.

The COVID virus is engineered and its agenda is to domesticate us. To psychologically isolate us from one another, and to prevent us from resisting the NWO when it starts on Nov 4 2021. It's a LIE.

In 1959, Aldous Huxley gave one of his last public speeches called “The Final Revolution” at UC medical school, where he stated: “There will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorships without tears, so to speak. Producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel – by propaganda, brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods; and this seems to be the final revolution.”

“The older dictators fell because they could never supply their subjects with enough bread, enough circuses, enough miracles, and mysteries. Under a scientific dictatorship, education will really work...most men and women will grow up to love their servitude and will never dream of revolution. There seems to be no good reason why a thoroughly scientific dictatorship should ever be overthrown.” -Aldous Huxley, “Brave New World Revisited” it.”


It is also interesting to note that Aldous was grandfathered into the Committee of 300 (Club of Rome) by his grandfather T.H Huxley who was also into eugenics and was referred to as “Darwins Bulldog” for his strong defense of Darwin’s theory of evolution. Natural selection has Always been closely associated with Eugenics. 

Eugenics (from Oxfordictionaries.com) the science of improving a human population by controlled breeding to increase the occurrence of desirable heritable characteristics.

Eugenics was indeed a hot topic among the Huxley’s circle. Aldous’ brother, Julian Huxley, was a noted eugenicist.  Julian was a longtime and influential member of the Eugenics Society (now called the Galton Institute), serving as its president from 1959 to 1969.

3 Points for Religious Exemption for Christians. Thoughts?,10,pgtqfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgtqfe/3_points_for_religious_exemption_for_christians/,11,1630626971.0,"I am planning on using these 3 points as to why as a Christian I will be refusing vaccination due to deeply held religious beliefs. You are free to scrutinize as you wish and I appreciate your feedback. It's worded in the context of my denomination but can be applied to the Christian faith universally. The translation used is the Peshitta Holy Bible Translated by Glenn David Bauscher, an english translation of the original Aramaic text used by our Church.

The three principles are the following:

""First Principle – The administration of vaccinations or any medical intervention related to or concerning the duties of a physician when a faithful member is not “very ill” is plainly spoken against by Our Lord, and as such, the administration of preventative medicines, such as vaccinations whose purpose is to be administered prior to one becoming very ill, stands directly against the spoken word of our Lord. As stated by the Lord Jesus Christ, we are told that there is no need for health intervention “except for those who have become very ill” The concept of vaccination, in which one healthy individual undergoes a medical intervention relating to the occupation of a physician would stand in contradiction with teachings from Jesus Christ who tells us that the healthy have no need for a physician except for those who have become very ill.

**Mark 2:17 “The healthy have no need for a physician, but those who have become very ill”**

Second Principle – MRNA vaccinations are designed to instruct one’s body to produce a protein which triggers an immune response, constituting a subversion of ones body, and as Christians we are instructed to cut off parts of our body which subvert us. The result of the mRNA vaccination places the faithful in a position where the faithful’s own body has been subverted (overthrown; destroyed) by the means of the genetic instruction from the vaccine and leads one’s own body to produce a harmful protein in an ultimate attempt to gain immunity from one’s subverted bodily immune reaction process.

**Mark 9: 43 “If your hand causes subverts you, cut it off, for it is better for you that you enter the Life maimed, than when you have two hands, you would go to Gehenna.” 44 “Where their worm does not die and their fire is not quenched.” 45 “If your foot subverts you, cut it off, for it is better for you to enter the Life crippled than when you have two feet that you should fall into Gehenna.” 46 “Where their worm does not die and their fire is not quenched.” 47 “And if your eye subverts you, pluck it out, for is better for you that you should enter the Kingdom of God with one eye than having two eyes that you should fall into the Gehenna of fire.”**

Third Principle  - Introduction of disease where it did not previously exist would contradict the religious beliefs of the faithful members of the Church who are instructed to kill diseases. Vaccinations, even if only at a small level, create disease deliberately in the body where it did not previously exist, this concept is directly opposed to beliefs of members of the Assyrian Church of the East. Creating a disease where one did not previously exist would stand in direct opposition to Bible instructions and faithful members believe that because of the technical creation of disease (created by vaccination), the anger of God comes upon those “disobedient children” (those who disobey the instruction) and is therefore against the faithful members of the Assyrian Church of the East.

**Colossians 3: 5 “Kill therefore your members that are in Earth: fornication, impurity, diseases, wicked desires, greed ( which is idol worship ),” 6 “For because of these things, the anger of God comes upon his disobedient children.”**

These are only 3 examples out of many other Biblical principles as interpreted by faithful members of the Assyrian Church of the East which would prevent believers from receiving a vaccination without violating deeply held religious beliefs, which are protected by Ontario Human Rights Law.

The term ""mark of the beast"" is almost always associated with Christianity, but before you read this post, please set aside any Christian biases or thoughts. Rather, try to read my post with an open mind, in order to determine if there is any logic to it first. 

Second, this post is actually not about the vaccine as the mark of the beast. Whatever your thoughts on the vaccine, it is clear, on most levels, it is being used as a desensitization tool, especially in regards to our liberty and rights. Quite simply, there are many reasons I believe the vaccine is not yet the mark, but this post is not about that.

This post is about what I logically think the mark will be, and I'd love the hear your thoughts.

**6G**

The creation of 6G was announced as early as 2018, even before 5G was fully implemented:

[https://www.pcmag.com/news/with-5g-still-in-the-works-6g-is-already-taking-shape](https://www.pcmag.com/news/with-5g-still-in-the-works-6g-is-already-taking-shape)

Believe it or not, and according to the above article, it is actually called 6Genesis, and I'll explain in a moment, why that name is very appropriate for the creation of their mark system.

Before I do that, I wanted to explain a little about what 6G entails. While the technology still appears to be in the making, it may be linked to the ""quantum internet,"" which you can read more about in this article:

[https://medium.com/predict/theres-5g-there-s-6g-and-then-there-s-the-unhackable-quantum-internet-c3d54dcd4151](https://medium.com/predict/theres-5g-there-s-6g-and-then-there-s-the-unhackable-quantum-internet-c3d54dcd4151)

In other words, if there is a 6G quantum system, it will be all tied to a one world internet system. One world? Where have I heard that phrase before?

**The New World**

Most reading this post know that *Genesis* is the first book of the Bible, which means ""beginning."" The term 6Genesis is all about their new beginning for their new world order. Note the number 6 though - whose beginning? : ) Now, if Christianity is true, it is important to remember that Satan hates God, and he is trying to set up the world in his way, not God's way. 

Genesis 6, by the way, is all about corrupt humans and the Nephilim:

[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206&version=NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206&version=NIV)

Anyway, let's continue. 

In order to be accepted into this new world, there must be a mark that identifies a person, but this mark isn't just a sign. It is actual integration into the new world. Let me explain.

People talk about transhumanism all of the time, even about how to prepare our children for their transhumanism future:

[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-prepare-our-kids-transhuman-future-doug-geiling?articleId=6466392309004066816](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-prepare-our-kids-transhuman-future-doug-geiling?articleId=6466392309004066816)

BBC reports that there are already transhumanists uploading their bodies:

[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-49893869](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-49893869)

So, this is not science fiction. And maybe to you that sounds great, but just for a moment, suppose you believe there is more to ourselves than our bodies. Whatever the soul is, it has yet to be proved or disproved by natural science:

[https://theconversation.com/whatever-the-soul-is-its-existence-cant-be-proved-or-disproved-by-natural-science-61244](https://theconversation.com/whatever-the-soul-is-its-existence-cant-be-proved-or-disproved-by-natural-science-61244)

**Becoming a Beast**

What separates animals and humans? It is quite simple. Animals may have some free will, but at a very limited capacity. Further, animals do not have a conscience on the same level as humans. I'm not here to argue about this point because whatever you believe, it is clear that humans ultimately have greater free will and capacity for thought than animals. At least for now.

Most of you have realized that we are slowly losing our rights, even our thoughts. In the beast system, or NWO, there will be no free will and no free thought - people will become complete slaves to the system.

In other words, people will decide to become like animals, but even worse. While they have the exciting word ""transhuman"", I'd like to use the word ""subhuman"" here. They will be less than human, or really, not human at all, when they decide to get this mark.

Now, if you know anything about Christianity, it is said that God can forgive man for all sins through Jesus - all of them, accept the unpardonable sin, which is blaspheming the holy spirit. This is where you need to pay attention.

People will choose the ""holy spirit"" of the beast system, which will render them unhuman. This could involve manipulating our blood or DNA on a larger scale than what is happening now - it could be a permanent effect turning us into different creatures all together. At that point, we are no longer human, and therefore, we are no longer able to be saved. God cannot pardon the sin because people are now tied to their new God, Satan.

**The NWO Paradise**

At first this beast system will seem AMAZING to these subhumans, though they will call themselves new and transformed. They will have anything they want, when they want, at their fingertips. 

However, they won't really be human anymore, will no longer have free will, and will realize they are trapped - that what appeared as paradise on the outside was quite the opposite. All their desires are there, but they are not satisfied.

They cannot leave - they are trapped for eternity. They scream in pain, in torture, and loneliness, but nobody, not even God, listens anymore because they have chosen to worship anything but Him.

Just to note, there is an episode of the Twilight Zone just like this:

The Plandemic is a burning house and the Vaccine is a cup of water.,4,pgswft,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgswft/the_plandemic_is_a_burning_house_and_the_vaccine/,5,1630624057.0,"SS: For those not in the loop on whats happening right now, ill break it down for you.

When a vaccine is made that doesnt make your body kill the virus it will create mutants that will become more and more deadly, but the vaccinated will be protected at first then will no longer work after a mutant is made that can bypass the vaccine like with delta . The vaccinated immune system is slowly being eroded by the vaccine, so they will become dependent on the vaccine to survive while the unvaccinated will have no problem if they got the bug and survived to get natural immunity.

Thats why they are trying to vaccinate everyone doesnt matter if you have natural immunity or not, the plan is just to inject as many as possible and make life like hell for those that arnt vaccinated.

The immunity system can have a good immune response or a bad one, but the catch is its permanent it stays with you for a life time. like auto immune doesnt just go away on its own.

TPAB are trying to destroy the immune systems of humans so they will have to depend on the gov and the new vax that are going to come out just to stay alive when the virus mutates into a deadly variant that kills 100% or less of the infected but the unvaccinated will be fine ""IF"" they got the virus early that wasnt deadly, then they will have immunity for life even if the virus mutates and is only 80% similar.

They are trying to paint a picture that the only way is to take the vaccine but in the short term its great right?? PS its not and in the long term its going to whip out a vast portion of the humans, but thinking for a head is too hard for most \^.

Like with merks chicken disease. In the beginging it didnt kill the chickens, but after years of vaccinating with a vaccine that stops the symptoms but not the spread it made a monster of a virus that kills 100% of the chickens that are unvaccinated. OH the irony""media screaming unvaccinated are makeing mutants"" lol while the truth is its selective pressure for the virus to mutate to a more deadly virus cuz why not if the host is not dying and can support deadly variants whats stoping a virus to not mutate to a deadler variant, but in nature there is no way a sane virus would survive if it mutates and kills its host cuz thats where the virus would die also. Nature doesnt allow deadly viruses to last long but with a little help from good old DR Fauci, we have a chance to make a one hell of super duper virus that kills 100% of the infected that didnt get the vaccine or have natural immunity from the lesser deadly variants.

To wrap it up:

Your immunity system is going to be a subscription service, if you dont do as they say whatever it might be, you will not get the vaccine which means death in a couple months or weeks living in fear and then you will remember the propaganda of people in hospitals begging to get the vaccine on their dying bed.

So moral of the story is If you are inside a burning house dont take cups of water/ vaccine to put out the fire, get out you might get burnt by the fire/virus 99.98% of the time its just going to be a small burn mark, and once you make it out you will forever not get burnt by the same house, BUT if you decide to try to put out the house fire with cups and cups of water/vaccine what awaits you is **Death.**

**TPTB** see how this world is going to end up if people do what people do best consume and destroy the environment, they just decided to take action in their hands and put a stop to humans and put them on a very tight leash those that survive. Smh what a time to be alive, well everyone remember we are all one, change your thoughts and reactions give your focus to the positive, your mind creates your reality so think and focus on something positive cuz thats the most beneficial thing we can do as a collective.

Love and light. cuz hate sucks!

Proof That The Pandemic Was Planned & With Purpose,10,pgsudq,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgsudq/proof_that_the_pandemic_was_planned_with_purpose/,14,1630623854.0,"*Published on September 30, 2020*

Written by **Dr James Fetzer**

A group of over **500 medical doctors** in Germany called ‘Doctors for Information’ made a shocking statement during a national press conference: (1)

>**‘The Corona panic is a play. It’s a scam. A swindle. It’s high time we understood that we’re in the midst of a global crime.’**

This large **group of medical experts** publishes a medical newspaper on 500,000 copies every week, to inform the public about the massive misinformation in the mainstream media. They also organize mass protests in Europe, like the one on August 29, 2020 where 12 million people signed up and several millions actually showed up.

Why do these **500+ medical doctors** say the pandemic is a global crime? What do they know, that we don’t? 

Planned pandemic protest Berlin.. Hundreds Of Spanish Medical Doctors Say The Pandemic Is Planned.. In Spain a group of **600 medical doctors** called ‘Doctors for Truth’, made a similar statement during a press conference. Doctors for truth Spain pandemic planned ‘Covid-19 is a false pandemic created for political purposes. This is a world dictatorship with a sanitary excuse. We urge doctors, the media and political authorities to stop this criminal operation, by spreading the truth.’ (2)

Germany and Spain are just two examples. Similar large groups of hundreds of medical experts exist in countries across the world.

In the USA a documentary called **PLANDEMIC**, which exposes COVID-19 as a criminal operation, is supported by over **27,000 medical doctors.**

Why are these thousands of medical professionals worldwide saying the pandemic is a crime? 

What information do they have access to, that we are not getting from the mainstream media?

I invite you to look at the following facts with an open mind and then come to your own conclusions…

**In 2015 A Testing Method Was Patented For… COVID-19. In 2015 a ‘System and Method for Testing for COVID-19’ was patented by Richard Rothschild, with a Dutch government organisation. Did you catch that? In 2015 – four years before the disease even existed – a testing method for COVID-19 was developed. (2B)**

This Coat of Arms from a French family (La Rochefoucauld) with deep roots to the Knights Templars from early 1500s AD has the entire map of the US on the neck of the woman holding the crown and yet they want us to believe the Americas were first visited by Columbus in 1492? Also, look at the Ancient looking men with yamakas or otherwise known as Kippahs. Why would a hidden map to the Americas from a French family have ancient Hebrew men with Yamakas? (Top pictures)  


The pictures on the (bottom) show the connection of this image to the Oak Island area in Nova Scotia, which has some amazing distinctive land features right around it including that large “C” structure, which can be found in a ton of French Royal paintings going back to 1300-1400 AD. Here is an actual link to much more detail on this family that was done by the Oak Island TV show:

Go and do a Google Map (Satellite) or Google Earth search for Oak Island area in Nova Scotia now.  They are trying to cover up the area with a silly off-colored rectangle to make it difficult for researchers to see the vast amount of connections to ancient relics such as art and maps to the area.

So why all the secrets? Here are links and research showing proof that ancient civilizations have been coming to the Americas for thousands of years: 

Ancient Sumerians, Babylonians and even Israelites are from North America and specifically Eastern Canada.  

The French knew this truth and have been coming to the area since building an alliance with Rome in 1200-1300 AD:

It was Rome who burnt down the real Jerusalem located in Quebec that sent the lost tribes of Israel  from this land where they became scattered around the world including the Middle East and other parts of the Americas. Many Native American tribes are really ancient Israelites:

This is one of the biggest secrets of the Masonic / Illuminati, which was created to protect the very large amount of Gold, Precious Metals and Agriculture used for medicines and sea travel.  Even today, Quebec has the largest Gold Mines in Canada due to a well known asteroid hit from thousands of years ago. 

The “Plains of Abraham” in Quebec includes the original Temple of Jerusalem, Tomb of King David, Solomon’s Mines and are located by a Mount Babel and even Solomon Islands. For fun, do a map search for the Garden of Eden, Ontario, Canada. Then look at these:

Show this to your Looney Brainwashed friends.

The human version of Ivermectin (aka Avermectin) is a prescription.  The media wants you to believe it's only for horses and comes from a feed store.  The next time you hear an idiot go off on this, give them the info -- and ask them if antibiotics are only for horses too.  

When is the last time a doctor refused to prescribe you penicillin because it's meant for horses?

Here's an example of where NBC is trying to scare you and your doctor away from Ivermectin:

They are also doing this with the Joe Rogan story where he took Ivermectin (along with other meds) and beat COVID in 3 days.

Read this if you actually want to make a difference,0,pgs3xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgs3xl/read_this_if_you_actually_want_to_make_a/,6,1630621400.0,"I'm sure there is some evidence for a few of the conspiracies on this subreddit, but the problem is that there are too many of them. If we can focus on one specific conspiracy that is well documented and extremely relevant, then we can actually make an impact. I think the perfect candidate for this is 9/11. I've found a documentary that is so thoroughly convincing that any sane, rational, patriotic, and intelligent person would be entirely convinced by the end of it that the highest members of the government perpetrated 9/11. I would know, I absolutely hate conspiracies and misinformation, and I was shocked and horrified. It's almost 5 hours long and dives into every detail of the event, combining all that we know. NORAD, the hijackers, the plane that hit the pentagon, the plane that crashed in PA, the two planes that hit the towers, and of course, WTC7. This documentary meticulously puts together every detail of the event, and the effect of combining everything we know about 9/11 is effective and compelling. If we can all work together to spread this documentary as much as possible, then for once we can make a huge impact on public opinion. 

If you feel somehow disconnected from the event after all these years, here is a video by TIME about the Falling Man.

https://youtu.be/SMDkvJRHaNM

Here is the documentary:

https://youtu.be/Rq9nUPs2RAk

It's implications are incalculable. Spread this everywhere. I cannot emphasize enough how important this is. 

When you are finished watching this documentary, here is a playlist I made that allows you to see the bigger picture, and how the government could possibly do something so terrible to its own citizens. Each of the videos is equally if not more compelling then the documentary you just watched.

But let's think about it for a minute. In an attempt to ""own the libs"" the Republican party has basically told their base to not wear masks or get vaccinated because it pisses the other half of the country off. This was the tune republicans sang for a very long time. Just recently the tune has changed, people like Trump and McConnell are telling people to get the shot, why is that? Maybe they have heard that every 10 days 8000 Republican voters die? I think they know these numbers and now since their own base has turned on them, they are planning for the future. Banning abortions basically guarantees multiple generations of unwanted uneducated people (criminals or blue collar republicans for the most part)",2021-09-02 22:20:25

They will not stop.

You will not be missed because no one that knew you will remain. 

They will come for you and you will go with them to your detriment.

* Gamma - Nov 2020
* Iota - Nov 2020
* Lambda - Dec 2020
* Eta - Dec 2020
* Mu - Jan 2021

The latest variant on this list is from Colombia in January and they didn't begin vaccination until [February](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccination_in_Colombia). People have speculated that it was the trials that caused variants, but let's look at when each company began their Phase IIIs:

* Pfizer - July 27th, 44k people
* Moderna - July 27th, 30k people
* J&J - September 23rd, 45k people

So if 120k people getting vaccinated caused multiple significant variants within 3-6 months of the trials beginning, how is it that more than _two billion people_ have been vaccinated in the past eight months and we haven't identified any new worrisome variants in the time since?

To be clear, the virus has been constantly mutating since the beginning and will continue to do so, likely evolving in response to the specific types of immunity that vaccines provide. That said, there is no evidence to show that this has happened yet.",2021-09-02 22:12:54

My Covid/Vaccine Theory. Thoughts,4,pgrqio,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgrqio/my_covidvaccine_theory_thoughts/,23,1630620226.0,"I do not believe that Bill Gates and Joe Biden are pushing a sterilization/depopulation poison as part of the vaccine.

This would take an insane number of participants and keeping that many people quiet seems unrealistic to me. Also, why would they poison a bunch of subservient ""Yes Men"" only to leave a bunch of people alive who do not submit or trust the government? Seems like a bad idea from a NWO takeover perspective. 

That does not change the fact that we are seeing some crazy shit when it comes to censorship and attacking anything that goes against the official narrative. So how do we explain this?

The core concepts behind my theory are below:

1. Politicians are in general, not intelligent people. They tend to want to stand behind ""experts"" when convenient. 
2. Fauci needed to cover up the dangerous research that, at minimum, happened at a lab he had funded. I feel this is not even a theory. It is pretty clear from his FOI email dump.
3. Covid provided more ammo to attack Trump and create looser voting laws. I am not claiming that the election was stolen, but simply loosening standards is enough to cause a different outcome.
4. Big companies, when provided legal and financial immunity, will never turn down a deal. I have been through this a 1000 times. Sales guy: ""Can we do this and make this deal"" Tech Guy:"" no we cannot"" Management:""We can figure it out. Make the deal""

So rather than being a satanic cabal and the vaccine being the mark of the beast, it's just a bad virus that we created for testing that unintentionally escaped from a lab. Then the dickhead partially responsible got famous while trying to cover up his mistake and loved the attention. Then the president went to big pharma with a rush job for a shitty half-ass tested product. This helps explain why they do not work too well and boosters for life is the new plan. As a bonus, it increased national voter participation to a level never seen before, legit or not. 

In the end this is just a big freakout, CYA lie that requires more lies to keep from getting caught. 

I will also say this is the first time I have ever been anti-vaxx. I worked in a hospital and have literally every other vaccine. I am also looking forward to the covid vaccine they come out with in a few years (like the years they said it would take before the election ;))

But there’s a lot of videos out there of farmers showing the Mail. With the huge binder on how to destroy crops. Even the guys hauling in the machines to destroy the crops are speaking out. Curious to know if you heard. And if so do you have any info you want to share. This scares me more than any conspiracy or sickness.

""Ivermectin is not proven to treat covid""

**Answer:**

Wrong, not only do in vitro studies show Ivermectin stops SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, but also new studies like this (below) are showing in vivo Ivermectin is working wonders at prevention of infection!

*""Results: Ivermectin prophylaxis was taken by 76 controls and 41 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (AOR 0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month. Those involved in physical activity (AOR 3.06 95% CI, 1.18-7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection. Type of household, COVID duty, single-dose ivermectin prophylaxis, vitamin-C prophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.”*

Xbox one Black Screen is planned obsolescence,7,pgqp2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgqp2y/xbox_one_black_screen_is_planned_obsolescence/,8,1630616495.0,"Recently for a lot of people that have Xbox one, they got a routine update that led to a Black Screen, where you only see the intro logo and transition but nothing else apart from ON/OFF options.

If you take a few minutes to think about, I find it abit odd that most people got it all at once after an update and there was no direct fix either. A lot of Xbox ones update by themselves as the console reboots itself automatically without the user's supervision, but the same after this update isn't possible as there hasn't been no correcting update even after weeks.

**Its suspect**

Xbox sales during 2021 won't too great compared to PS5, prehaps they feel that present gamers have become somewhat Loyalists and comfortable with the old generation of content/culmination of progress and of backwards compatibility on the Xbox one with 360. They need some type of urgent boost in sales, and this could be the way to go. 

**What it means**

The current fix at the moment is to FACTORY RESET, which means virtually all saved games, and progress not on cloud will essentially be erased. If you consider the present gamers and 'somewhat loyalists' as mentioned above, they're the one's going to be most hurt by the factory reset, especially those without an external backup. Once you've lost years maybe even decades almost of progress and content you're likely to diverge to the new gen or switch all together.

Ultimately I feel like Xbox have taken a gamble with this one and it's either going to work in PS5's favour or boost their sales just before Christmas holidays ;) .

Disclaimer:

This is a theory, so I'd like some gamers or anyone to provide some insight, correct and disapprove wherever, feel free. It was just my inclination that this is very suspect and relatively cuts out the old gen enthusiast or deters them to an extent",2021-09-02 21:01:35

Why are the dedicated scientists who actually study the virus & mutations under a microscope not on this board too helping to make the big decisions?

I get that most of these people joined before covid, and before covid their titles were relevant and their decisions didn't hold this much weight. But now their decisions affect everyone in the US and you'd think they'd bring in more relevant people / a broader array of scientists to be calling the shots, instead of having pediatric doctors and professors who are obviously biased twords vaccines in any circumstance read some studies and make decisions for the whole country....

He didn't deserve to die. However, the media intentionally tried to play black vs white, black lives matter vs blue lives matter, democrat's vs republicans. It personally triggered me last year because I repeatedly kept seeing the footage and it was talked about non stop. The reason I say it was intentional is because people are murdered all the time of every race and a lot of times by their own race! From cops to regular people but the focus was only on that cop. Not every cop is bad. It was tough because I have been racial profiled and dealt with racism from police so the media was playing on that. It's not right to group people. Why couldn't it just have been a cop heinously murdered a man. It was race baiting as well as bashing cops. Both are important. Black lives as well as police. Also every race of life matters. Then with the protests I saw it from both sides. People were right to be against rioting and businesses destroyed and vandalized but I also saw protesters views because the media was playing on racism and hate and that was causing anger. I was angry last year but now that I have had time to see things you can't say all cops are bad because one cop nor can you judge an entire race off a select fews actions. The media knows how to influence African Americans because of 400 years of slavery and paint a picture of race.

I wish we could have all came to the conclusion that the murder was wrong and heinous no matter what Floyd's background and history were and cop was wrong. However, not condemn every cop because of ones actions. Accept that racism exists and all minorites deal with racism. Also whites may not have racism but there will always be hatred from others such as discrimination for sexual orientation, being a woman, religion, now vaccination status, etc. No race is better than any other. We are all people that just have different colors. I love you all. I would love for ideas on how to make this world better",2021-09-02 19:55:01

Trump Replaced?,0,pgp8zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgp8zx/trump_replaced/,20,1630612055.0,"Guy at work says Trump got switched out at Walter Reed, like Eminem or Dave Chappelle.

This one's weird. Listen.

Early November 2019 the Pentagon intercepts Chinese communication about new coronavirus coming out of Wuhan that lines up with Samoa canceling schools after 6 kids die from strange flu and people in France getting sick.

November 16th they take Trump to Walter Reed to administer an antidote/vaccine for the manufactured virus bio-weapon cause it's not supposed to be released on the public yet.

What they actually do there is re-sequence Trump's DNA.

A year later in October he gets Covid and, get this, DIES. Good thing they got another Trump incubating so they just replace him and that's why he is struggling on the balcony. His lungs are used to liquid oxygen and he's learning how to breathe.

NOW he's saying strange things like ""Take the vaccine! I did it! It's good!""

Even stranger, it's not the first time he was replaced. They killed him in the middle of a tweet about Covid in 2017. The Covfefe tweet. He tweets what he can get out to try to warn us.

Planned Parenthood President SKETCHY Connections,2,pgp2yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgp2yv/planned_parenthood_president_sketchy_connections/,11,1630611528.0,"Hello All, 

I'm seeing a lot of upset liberals and triggered teenage girls on the front page of reddit complaining about the abortion laws in Texas. The President of Planned Parenthood is even doing her rounds on the left leaning news networks to spin her special brand of evil propaganda. Reading through all of this I started to do some research. Always remember this: people in power DO NOT care about you, your community, your ""culture"" or your wellbeing in any way. They care about profit and their agenda. And the agenda is fueled by dirty money and extremely shady business ventures. 

First off, the current President of Planned Parenthood is [**Alexis McGill Johnson**](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/our-leadership/alexis-mcgill-johnson). 

Mrs. Johnson is currently married to a man named **Robert Johnson**, who is the founder and CEO/President of the 'non-profit' organization known as Institute for [New Economic Thinking](https://www.ineteconomics.org)

Looking into her husbands company you instantly, if you have eyes to see, can see the angle and spin they are operating from. They are part in parcel of the globalist agenda. This is where things get interesting! 

Taking a stroll through their finances here: [Company Funding](https://www.causeiq.com/organizations/institute-for-new-economic-thinking,271916040)
You will be able to notice a few key things:
*Largest Donor is literally [George Soros Open Society Foundation](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/) at $6.2 MILLION in 2018
*Soros is listed as the Co-Founder of the org
*They are an [IRS Pub 78](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs-pub-78.asp) company, which means ""Beginning in the tax year 2019, taxpayers are able to deduct up to 60% of their adjusted gross income (AGI) in charitable contributions. ""
*[Here](https://www.causeiq.com/organizations/view_990/271916040/6cccf2e66572bc0ef29eb7990f5e2637) is their 2018 Form 990 for Institute for New Economic Thinking

Here is their company Description: Description
To nurture a global community of next-generation economic leaders, to provoke new economic thinking, and to inspire the economics profession to engage the vital social and economic challenges of the 21st century.

Does any of this seem interesting to you? I'm not an accountant or a tax professional, but just the connection to Soros alone is interesting. Then, to have this woman on top of Planned Parenthood be married to someone that is directly paid and sponsored by George Soros seems questionable at best. 

Point I'm making with all of this is that to the average person, they see the President or CEO of a place like Planned Parenthood, a brown woman, and automatically give her their trust and devotion, assuming she is a good spirited individual with positive aims and goals. Doesn't seem to be the case considering in about 15 minutes I found her and her husbands little money laundering operation connected to one of the great evil dudes out there.",2021-09-02 19:38:48

> 25 August 2021

> Strict safeguards are needed around the South Australian government use of new technology for home quarantine, digital rights advocates say, with individuals to use facial recognition software and geolocation tracking as part of the trial.

> South Australia launched a trial of home-based quarantine for people returning from NSW or Victoria this week. The pilot will involve participants using the new Home Quarantine SA app being contacted at random and required to provide proof of their location within 15 minutes.

> Australia Traded Away Too Much Liberty - How long can a democracy maintain emergency restrictions and still call itself a free country?

> The nation’s high court struck down a challenge to the country’s COVID-19 restrictions. “It may be accepted that the travel restrictions are harsh. It may also be accepted that they intrude upon individual rights,” it ruled. “But Parliament was aware of that.” Until last month, Australians who are residents of foreign countries were exempt from the rule so they could return to their residence. But the government tightened the restrictions further, trapping many of them in the country too.

> Intrastate travel within Australia is also severely restricted. And the government of South Australia, one of the country’s six states, developed and is now testing an app as Orwellian as any in the free world to enforce its quarantine rules. People in South Australia will be forced to download an app that combines facial recognition and geolocation. The state will text them at random times, and thereafter they will have 15 minutes to take a picture of their face in the location where they are supposed to be. Should they fail, the local police department will be sent to follow up in person. “We don’t tell them how often or when, on a random basis they have to reply within 15 minutes,” Premier Steven Marshall explained. “I think every South Australian should feel pretty proud that we are the national pilot for the home-based quarantine app.”

"Shills: A Thread - Part One “When you tear out a man’s tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you’re only telling the world that you fear what he might say.”",114,pgokil,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgokil/shills_a_thread_part_one_when_you_tear_out_a_mans/,14,1630609940.0,"What I am about to say is very important. But first, let’s talk about shills real quickly. This post will almost assuredly get attacked by shills. (No I don’t mean anyone who disagrees with me – that’s one of their favorite lines).  I mean shills. People who are explicitly here for one reason, and one reason only: to control the narrative and dictate the flow of information. 
 

Shills are very easy to spot, especially for veterans of this sub. Before I am attacked for the length of my account being on here, I’ll get ahead of the curve and let it be known I have used many other names in the past. You see, their lines and arguments become very easy to spot on the conspiracy sub. They blend so easily well in subs like WorldNews and Politics. So well, that it’s become an echo chamber of shills, and bots, with mostly no real thought or content. Any real counterpoints are hive mind downvoted, and that’s if you’re lucky enough not to get instantly banned for WrongThink.

What makes this sub different, is the entire point of this sub’s existence. So, when a user comes in here with that exact set of narrative lines, they always seem to be the same; A person who is anti-gun, pro-mRNA shot, pro-lockdown, anti-Trump (really anti conservative anything), anti-capitalism, pro-marxist, pro-gender pronoun, anti-freedom in the name of “safety”. 

That begs the question, what in the ever living fuck are they doing here? If you discredit conspiracies 24/7 and ask for official sources, why are you in this sub? That’s where their intent is obvious. This sub once upon a time was mostly aliens, bigfoot, cia, fun stuff. Btw, r/highstrangeness is great for all of that now if you’re looking for old fashioned conspiracies.


Again, getting ahead of the shills who will no doubt scour my entire history and find anything they can to smear me (that seems to be one of their favorite things to do) I’m not “far-right”. I’m not Republican. I’m not even a Democrat. I refuse to be labeled into a camp and stick to pure party lines against my own beliefs. You see, that’s what makes us humans. That’s what makes us individuals with freedom of expression and freedom to believe in things that others may not. It’s the mark of an educated mind to entertain others’ thoughts without necessarily accepting them.

My next point about shills. They like to reply to well-known rhetorical facts with “Source? Oh that’s right OP just pulled it out of his ass.”  Seriously. They love saying that. Pay attention. Here’s why that battle isn’t worth having with them. They don’t actually care about your source. Their goal is to get visibly upvoted, to then sow doubt about whatever is being talked about. Again, controlling the flow of information. & it doesn’t matter if you prove them wrong. They will then label it as ‘misinformation’.  Or, they will attack the source itself. The elites have consolidated “credible journalism” under a few recognizable names. Unless it comes from Washington Post or NYTimes, it’s got to be fake news to them. That’s not what journalism is about at all. Focus less on the outlet, and more on the content itself. That’s how journalism should be, and needs to be. 

You’re not their teacher. You don’t need to do their homework for them. If they care so much, let them use their own two hands and look it up themselves. While I do think there should be a balance (like posting random twitter screenshots), most of the content is self evident and requires little time to check the information for yourself. Like you should. You should be able to freely inquire from all sorts of outlets, opinions, publications, etc. and form your own independent thoughts on a matter and not have it spoon fed to you through editorialized and corporatized bullshit. You don’t need some talking head on TV to have a segment to tell you what to think. They hate independent, critical thinkers who assess all available information at their disposal and form a rational, logical conclusion based on your own judgement. They hate that. It’s a losing war for them.

Their ideology cannot hold up in a debate, and so they silence, delete, censor, ban, fact-check (from privately funded donors with a clear agenda) all opposing viewpoints. Just like banning the President from social media. Just like banning users on Facebook for supposed misinformation. Just like deleting the No New Normal sub. Please spare me the “how many people have died because of these hateful subs” bullshit, shills. Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety. This is not, and will not, be a nanny state, with elites, Klaus Schwab, George Soros, President Xi, the CCP, Mossad, The World Economic Forum, and the Trilateral Commission telling We the People, what we are allowed to think about our reality.


Finally, my last point about shills before moving on, the concept of freedom of speech, and private companies. One of their favorite talking points. First, it’s very important as a conspiracy sub to understand that the CIA, and other intelligence agencies from countries I won’t mention (wink, wink) knew from the inception of the internet, what it would someday become. Sure, it started out as chat rooms, fringe sites, AOL instant messenger with buddies, and MySpace to connect with friends. But it quickly evolved and the big players in the world knew that maintain their grip on the flow of information was irrevocably their most important goal to keep their power intact. After all, when people finally realized the power of the internet, how would they keep up their influence (looking at you MK Ultra) when people moved on from newspapers, radio, TV commercials, and other analog means of messaging? That’s right. Expanding their reach onto the Internet.

The argument “___” is a private company so they can do whatever and it’s not censorship” is wrong when ___ is a monopoly of a public utility. Conventional wisdom holds that technology companies are free to regulate content because they are private, and the First Amendment protects only against government censorship. That view is wrong; Google, Facebook, and Twitter should be treated as state actors under existing legal doctrines. Using a combination of statutory inducements and regulatory threats, Congress has co-opted Silicon Valley to do through the back door what government cannot directly accomplish under the Constitution. It is also imperative that people understand these companies did not succeed without intervention from the state. They create social media monopolies that dictate the flow of information. 

Make no mistake, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, and Reddit didn’t get lucky. They were assisted along the way. It’s why every alternative gets shutdown, or never really takes off in general. They are essentially the social media branch of the government.

They always knew this would be the end result, stifling any discourse, dissent, hesitancy, alternative beliefs, etc. They knew one day their charade of the fake manufactured reality they have so carefully crafted through the decades would be seen for what it is. People are waking up. The only way to keep the House of Cards from falling apart is to maintain their clutches on information distribution. The only difference between truth and conspiracy… is about twelve months.   Part 2 will be directly followed after this. Please upvote this for visibility if you believe in the things I have stated, and will continue to state in Part 2, to gaining back our ability to speak freely to one another on this platform while not letting shills invade or divide us.",2021-09-02 19:12:20

Toronto/Ontario - Vax Passports are coming - What can we do? My Experience...,10,pgnk4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgnk4f/torontoontario_vax_passports_are_coming_what_can/,8,1630606896.0,"  

Seeing as these Green Pass posts and Vax Passports are quickly becoming the lightning-rod we knew they would, I figured I’d share an experience of light activism, something that many more people may consider doing in the coming weeks and months.

I was finally able to attend a Freedom Rally in Toronto this weekend – Aug 28th, leaving Queen's Park (Ontario City Hall) and walking down several larger streets, massing and demonstrating largely peacefully for about 5-8 KM. 

The crowd was what you would expect for Toronto, a mixed-bag of ages, sexes - many different personality types. I felt like the group while small, held potential. There were some louder proponents, some more muted ones, some happy ones, some fired-up ones. Overall, it was very peaceable and enjoyable. People handed out cards, pamphlets, papers, etc., all in good faith to combat the division being thrust upon us. The time is probably now to take to the streets, in Ontario the Vax passport is being proposed in effect on Sept 22nd. I still hold out hope that pressure and common sense will prevail, but alas, these things are fleeting since I’d say, 2001 (ahem-ahem). I was in 1st year university, my first day of school when the ‘planes’ hit the towers. That was my generation’s wake up call, this is the new generation’s wake up call.

Back to the Protest. We closed 2 lanes of major streets, like major Toronto streets, on a Saturday in August. You’d think there would be some police, or traffic management, wouldn’t you? I mean there were maybe only 200-300 total people there (my estimation may be off – I’d say maybe underestimated), but it was sizeable enough to warrant some sort of police presence. We took the walk/march past a police station and stopped for 10 minutes or so, still no police. Well, did the Media show up to see what was going on? NOPE. No media, anywhere, independent, or otherwise. So strange, almost like there’s no interest in showing the other side of the coin. 

There were enough additional distressing points, namely the amount of masked people outdoors giving us the finger, wishing death upon us, and generally just not observing the “love thy neighbor”. There was one violent interaction, ironically as soon as the police arrived, and if I’m not mistaken the Police actually arrested the aggressor (not the demonstrator) which was refreshing. The amount of brainwashing is alarming however. All I could think during the walk was something like “we are doing this for you”, but that’s too altruistic, I’m doing it for myself, for my kids, for SOME KIND OF FUTURE. But I’ll be out there whenever I can, and I would suggest that if you are anything like me, and believe that Freedom is an inalienable right, you’ll continue to disobey, whether in a civil manner, or even just in the privacy of your own thoughts, where you do not let fear, division and the absurdity dull your critical senses.

No surprise since we seen a foreshadowing of how many vaccines it might take to fight this bio-weapon. At current it is 2 or 3 in some places with booster shots. But it did occur to me that at first they was naming the variants in Greek origin. After the MU announcement yesterday it has dawned on me. This is not Greek - it is frequencies.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu\_wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_wave)

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/mu-rhythm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/mu-rhythm)

&#x200B;

This goes back to the graphene oxide. My theory is that it is creating some sort of interface. According to MU frequencies, "" Assorted investigators are also in the process of using mu rhythms to develop a new technology: the [brain–computer interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface) (BCI). With the emergence of BCI systems, clinicians hope to give the severely physically disabled population new methods of communication and a means to manipulate and navigate their environments. ""

&#x200B;

This looks to be good on curing some diseases, but this can have devastating affects either way to humans. Because with the use of this frequency, they can control humans.

&#x200B;

 ""**The sensorimotor mu rhythm**, also known as **mu wave**, comb or wicket rhythms or arciform rhythms, are [synchronized patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_oscillation) of electrical activity involving large numbers of [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron), probably of the [pyramidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidal_cell) type, in the part of the brain that controls voluntary movement"".

&#x200B;

Where do we stand? What is to happen next? The MU variant/experiment will be tested worldwide with frequencies and see if affects are noticeable. They have plans when people start dropping dead by deploying troops to contain and detain protestors and riots. Or a military presence when death rises - looking at you [https://unum.nsin.us/xviii-airborne](https://unum.nsin.us/xviii-airborne)

The Gotthard Tunnel and the Satanic Illuminati. Demonic symbolism. A portal to hell and the awakening of the Antichrist?,177,pglnm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pglnm1/the_gotthard_tunnel_and_the_satanic_illuminati/,83,1630601140.0,"Today I began my research on an interesting topic. 

On Wednesday, June 1st, 2016 the Swiss Government, after 17 years of work, live streamed a satanic production to the world to celebrate the opening of the new Gotthard train and tunnel-- **the world's longest and deepest railroad**. With a route length of 35.5 miles. It consists of two tunnels one for each direction totaling 94 miles. It takes 20 minutes to cross the length of the tunnel at 155mph. 

The swiss drilled 2,300 meters below the mountain. 

[This makes the Gotthard base tunnel the deepest tunnel on Earth.](https://www.newlyswissed.com/gotthard-base-tunnel-figures/)

The production included over **600** actors and dancers and came with a price tag of over 8 million Euros. Dignitaries from **six** nations were in attendance. The ceremony was broadcast live across the world through RT, BBC, and other major European outlets. 

&#x200B;

[Screenshot from the opening ceremony livestream depicting a goat-man. ](https://preview.redd.it/yymlzvnaw3l71.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc6a66c72c544a9b4d249a8a9a394bf0f344ecf7)

You can watch the live streamed occult practice video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW5gklIKcDg). 

At the Gotthard Train Tunnel's northern portal in Erstfield, Switzerland, hundreds of dignitaries including Italian Prime minister Matteo Renzi, Switzerland's President Johann Schneider-Ammann, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, and France's President Francoise Hollande attended the illuminati-esqe ceremony. The list of the high-profile attendees is [here](https://securetherepublic.com/arkansas/2016/06/25/nwo-leaders-attend-occult-ritual-in-switzerland-european-stocks-fall/). 

&#x200B;

[A screenshot of the watching crowd in the 1st half of the opening ceremony. ](https://preview.redd.it/xcag5djkw3l71.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0cc0cb684dca426ec9981a4371ea476db7a4700)

&#x200B;

[Several screenshots of the 2nd half of the ceremony which was filmed inside the Northern portal coordinated by German director Volker Hesse. ](https://preview.redd.it/2jcwdjq8x3l71.jpg?width=696&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52e149e3beea67d81c62fe0dfe7f38e51a7aab83)

The Gotthard ritual was split into two events. Both were filled with graphic demonic symbolism. Over the course of three days 160,000 people attended both events at four locations. 

Both Swiss and French articles called the new tunnel an [""invisible cathedral.""](https://www.expatica.com/ch/uncategorized/sw-gotthard-tunnel-global-media-praise-a-national-obsession-59798/)

It is important to note that a total of nine miners died during construction of the tunnel. During the ceremony it is represented as nine miners hanging from the ceiling on metal rings, posing as dead. Which is a very unorthodox tribute.

Here's a breakdown of the major symbolisms in the ceremony.

* They used a mixed language of Italian and ancient Germanic. (Ancient Germanic is connected to occult, paganism, and druidism. You can find that [here](https://occultthirdreich.wordpress.com/2011/06/20/ariosophy-and-the-runes/).)
* A goat-headed man, representing [satan](https://www.spiritualsatanist.com/essays/satanism/baphomet-why-goats-are-satanic.html), emerges and dances before the crowd.
* On the video screen a picture of the goat head morphs into a screaming human male face. This could represent the form of satan entering into the world as a man-- the [Antichrist](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Thessalonians-2-3_2-12/). 
* Miners dressed in orange remove their suits then work in tribal unity, like hypnotized zombies, to open an abyss pictured above them on a video screen. This could represent a link to CERN.
* Three Egyptian scarabs hang above the screen. Scarabs [symbolize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarab) the heavenly cycle and rebirth because they consume the flesh of the dead. 
* 56 Musicians stand in two rows of 28. The number 28 is said to be a [perfect number](https://byjus.com/maths/perfect-numbers/) and is the ninth and last number in [Indian magic square order of 3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-81-322-1053-5_18). 28 is the [fourth magic number](https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/magicnumbers2.htm) in physics. The average human female menstrual cycle is 28 days. There are 28 countries in the EU.  And, in Hebrew Gematria, koakh meaning “power”, “energy” is a word that corresponds to the number 28.
* The number 56 is a [semiperfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/56_(number)) number since 56 is twice a perfect number. As such, the Pythagoreans linked a polygon of 56 sides to the giant [Typhon](https://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/leg/leg56.htm) in Greek Mythology.  There are 56 cards in a [tarot](https://astronlogia.com/tarot-cards/how-many-cards-in-a-tarot-deck/) deck. 
* The goat head man, (satan) has sex with a woman dressed in white. Then a woman dressed in red emerges, pregnant. The woman in red gives birth to human, conceived from satan. Representing the [Antichrist](https://www.whatchristianswanttoknow.com/top-8-bible-verses-that-mention-the-antichrist/). This represents the culmination of satan's quest to imitate what God has done in Jesus Christ. 
* A clock appears on the screen spinning clockwise and counterclockwise pausing at 9:10, 9:15, 9:20. The actors bow before the clock and the red woman. Could the times represent an event happening September 10th, 15th, 20th?
* Three men in suits wearing large heads, representing the elite/Illuminati emerge and dance before the other dancers. 
* There was symbolism of hybrids/chimera's throughout the performance as well. Representing the human hybrids found in the book of [Genesis](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-Chapter-6/) before the flood. Some think the Illuminati have been able to create these hybrids again. The Bible forewarns us about the end times being like the days of Noah. ""For the coming of the Son of Man will be as the days of Noah."" - Matthew 24:6

&#x200B;

[A photo of the inside of the Gotthard Tunnel](https://preview.redd.it/7rom5u3s94l71.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfb846461a32b427d6cd284d89542105d55226ed)

I did some more digging and found the word Gotthard means [""God Hard""](http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/Gotthard) . 

[In short, I strongly believe this tunnel has ties with the NWO Elite and their satanic plot to create a one world government, one world currency, and one world religion where the Antichrist is leader](https://www.gotquestions.org/one-world-government.html). 

The Bible [warns us](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Bible-Verses-About-World-Government/) of these times. 

I pray that some of you may see the rise in satanism, the rise in violence, lies, and treachery from our Governments across the world and realize what is truly happening right before our eyes. 

I pray that some of you many see this and know that amongst this growing evil we have a God who has given us a way out of it. I pray that some of you may repent and know the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross and his raising from the dead to conquer our sins. Thank you for reading.

People are ingesting news no more by simply reading the headlines for confirmation bias, the same way social media algorithms promote mindless scrolling and “likes.”

Case and point;

They influence and reinforce their target audience by aligning Joe with ingesting horse medicine, to mock and ridicule alternative treatments. When in fact all he said was he took Ivermectin, not horse paste.
https://mashable.com/article/joe-rogan-covid-ivermectin-horse-drug

Or mass media use blatant lies, by first reporting something wildly inaccurate, and then later adds a small “correction,” but by that time it is corrected, the masses have been influenced and the damage is done. The case below reports 5,800 child hospital admissions!!! But the correction says oh wait that number was wrong, it’s 783.

There’s a crazy “Holier than thou” attitude coming from people who have been vaccinated. And I’m worried it’s going to lead to discrimination “this pandemic could’ve been over with by now if it wasn’t for people like you” stuff like that. 

Idk maybe I need a break from the internet but i feel like burying my head in the sand isn’t going to help. This is some serious shit that’s happening all over the world right now. 

Comply with the overlords and get vaccine/play along for pretend freedom, or fight for what I believe in and risk losing freedoms. That’s where I’m at, thanks if you read. 

Btw. I do believe that just getting the shot isn’t going to be the end of it. But I’m worried at some point it may be too late",2021-09-02 16:07:38

If you paid any attention though, the only place you found that news positively was here on this subreddit. 

Many other large subreddits used the opportunity to ensure the narrative was very different:

""Here's a video of Bill Burr owning Joe Rogan on masks"" was the main one, cross posted across various subs.

The talking points that the community upvoted all made fun of him and denigrated him for getting the virus, quotes from the video by Bill, for how he chose to get treatment, horse paste, etc etc. 

None of them were like ""Hey, Joe got better, whatever he did worked, good for him""

They just want you to hate him and think he's crazy, foolish and dangerous. They attack his character and avoid the actual story. 

This is the real brigade. It's not by accident. When a story pops up they don't like, they find strategic ways to get their talking points out to muddy the waters and make.it seem like the majority of people believe things one way.

How they count Covid deaths. The death numbers are totally inaccurate.,9,pgksbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgksbr/how_they_count_covid_deaths_the_death_numbers_are/,9,1630598476.0,"From the Director of the Illinois Board of Public Health. https://imgur.com/gallery/kp7w0BU

There's a difference between dying FROM Covid and dying WITH Covid, but many states don't differentiate between the two. 

Patients who are in hospice and have weeks to live but test positive for covid are counted as Covid deaths when they die.

Even if there is a clear alternate cause, if you test positive for Covid, you are counted as a Covid death.

The Covid death numbers are greatly exaggerated. Imagine if you had stomach cancer and the chicken pox, but they list you as a chicken pox death on the death certificate. That's what they're doing here. 

Here is a story about a man who died in a motorcycle accident but was still counted as a Covid death:

A couple things to understand. He's paid enormous sums of money in our society for something that deserves peanuts (essentially a social media influencer that's paid extra BIG $$$ on the side), that's your first hint. I don't care who the little man is, if he's a nice guy or a dick. The bottom line, if you are even just aware of this person's talents from **UFC-related work > being a super-boring host (with zero charisma) on a REALLY stupid TV show (that was worse than half the 90's MTV spin-offs) > ""Conspiracy theorist"" (as a ""referee"" archetype of sorts)**


So, this nobody in a sea of has-beens and sociopaths desperate for TV fame and cash gets a fucking gigantic 100M spotify deal with the resume above, fyi.


This person has no discernible skills at the microphone. The value is in his demeanor and in the presentation. The slightly anarchist, ""deep""-thinking cool dude with tats. Takes a few steps down the rabbit hole (just a couple steps) and brings on the personalities to ""dabble"" in discussion, and then stop the talk or change the subject like a trained dog.

With Joe's signature tone and demeanor, like a stoned teenager learning about bldg 7 for the first time.. ""Wow, maaaaan.. Really?"" -type nonsense. Like peeing on your leg and tell you it's raining. The time he had the other stooge Jesse on and Joe took Jesse's 9/11 is an inside job talk and veered the discussion directly into the ditch almost immediately before the subject could get ANY legs at all. That's what Joe is in a nutshell.

A controlled opposition ""host"" that brings ""the people that talk about all this stuff"" onto his platform and mold it into a piece of shit that means nothing. Yes he serves a certain echelon of thinkers >> 18-and-deep let's say. We all know what Joe WON'T discuss but that's for another thread.

Anyway, the point of the post, and I'll make it short, like Joe. And frankly this is way more than I ever care to type about him.

The dichotomy they need us to be remain in is that this ""virus"" is *real* and ""still around"", etc. And by real I mean not that it DOESN'T exist at *all*, but that this thing is a super dangerous sickness (boogie man) that you can only see through a test. And he ""got it""!!! Oh the horror.


Sort of like keeping the narrative going in a discussion that ""Muslim extremists"" did 9/11, and to remain focused on the boogie man, not the fact before your eyes.

So lil' Joe is next up on the wheel of paid whores to walk the red carpeted MSM shit show ""Covid"" skit. The skit is keeping this bullshit in the front of your thoughts. Now the captain of the 18-and-deeps ""has Covid"" so that's where he stands on the subject. It's not the flu or a cold, Joe?

It's cementing a fake narrative, and look who he is. He's the Johnny Carson of ""conspiracies"" in this shithole we live in.

Since then, there has been ongoing research into SARS, including dangerous gain-of-function research/dual-use research of concern, both of which are merely euphemisms for bioweapon research. The excuse for GOF research, “getting ahead of zoonotic emergence”, is not scientific. Chimeric pathogens modified to be more virulent in humans have no real relation to wild-type viruses at all. It is basically an excuse to conduct research into weaponizing pathogens.

Over the course of the past two decades, it was discovered that SARS-CoV was basically impossible to safely vaccinate against with a whole-virus vaccine. In an animal model, there was eosinophil infiltration in the lungs and immunopathology in vaccinated ferrets.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421

Also, it has been shown that dangerous betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may have a feature known as ADE, or antibody-dependent enhancement of disease.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7022351/

In other words, it was shown that vaccination to SARS could lead to immune sensitization, much like how Sanofi’s Dengvaxia failed in the Philippines. 

In 2014, there was a moratorium on federal funding for SARS gain-of-function research due to the enormous risks of the work (which are playing out in front of us IRL right now). This research never stopped being conducted with federal funding. As a matter of fact, not only did Dr. Ralph Baric collaborate with Shi Zhengli and co-write a paper with her, the proscribed research was outsourced to the Wuhan Institute of Virology by way of Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance NGO, who essentially laundered government grants.

https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985

NIH contributed a few million dollars to this work. However, their contribution was dwarfed by the tens of millions given by the DOD and USAID. That is, the Pentagon and the lackeys of the US State Department. All of this has been well documented and the paper trails are undeniable.

https://peterdaszak.com/

To make a long story short, Anthony Fauci blatantly lied in front of Congress when he stated that gain-of-function research was not being conducted.

In November 2019, a number of lab technicians at the Wuhan Institute of Virology came down with a flu-like sickness.

https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20210524/wuhan-lab-researchers-illness

Peter Daszak, having back channels to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, knew immediately what happened at the lab, because Shi Zhengli or one of her associates contacted him immediately. So did Anthony Fauci and Ralph Baric. As a matter of fact, Ralph Baric received confidential Coronavirus mRNA vaccine-related materials co-owned by Moderna and the NIH in December of 2019:

https://patriotpost.us/articles/81327-when-did-moderna-know-about-covid-19-2021-07-15

https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/06/18/confidential-documents-reveal-moderna-sent-mrna-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate-to-university-researchers-weeks-before-emergence-of-covid-19/

https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/6935295/NIH-Moderna-Confidential-Agreements.pdf

This was a whole month before China allegedly sent us the sequence for 2019-nCoV, or what would become known as SARS-CoV-2, so named for its close sequence homology to SARS. Moderna is on record as having stated that they produced the vaccine two days after receiving the sequence in mid-January, 2020.

What this means is that there are back channels between Moderna and the WIV that we are not privy to. It also means that the people responsible for the vaccine are the same people responsible for the virus.

David Martin and M-CAM’s work unraveling the patents behind the virus show this to be the case.

https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/8079569/The%20FauciCOVID-19%20Dossier.pdf

Peter Daszak went on to be part of the WHO investigative team in Wuhan, investigating his own crimes. He was also one of the people who penned the Lancet letter denying the lab leak hypothesis.

Not only did the virus leak from a laboratory, the people responsible for Moderna’s mRNA vaccine are directly linked to the people who created SARS-CoV-2, which is an artificial chimera and did not come from nature. I repeat, the virus and the vaccine were made by the same people.

This, on its own, constitutes the greatest crime against humanity in human history. Mass murder, fraud, and racketeering so vast in scope that it boggles the mind. 

However, the horror story is only just beginning. 

Why are the authorities so desperate to vaccinate people, with a vaccine that was given an emergency use authorization, which confers rapidly-fading immunity that needs to be endlessly topped off with boosters, and has numerous known and unknown side effects, for a disease that isn’t particularly lethal in absolute terms? Surely, people would learn about ADE and the risks involved. Surely, people would discover that SARS-CoV-2 Spike is, in itself, a pathogenic protein that causes inflammation on its own and is amyloidogenic. So why?

Enter Charles Lieber. For twenty years, Charles Lieber has conducted silicon nanowire research at Harvard with ONR, DARPA, NIH, AFOSR, and MITRE funding. His papers can be read for free, online.

http://cml.harvard.edu/

MITRE is its own can of worms:

https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Mitre_Corporation

In 2020, Charles Lieber was charged with fraud. He had violated the terms of his government grants, taking money from the PLA’s Thousand Talents plan, which is a Chinese program to bribe Western scientists into relinquishing proprietary R&D in such a way that China can copy it.

https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/harvard-university-professor-and-two-chinese-nationals-charged-three-separate-china-related

Allegedly, he was working on silicon nanowire batteries in China. Charles Lieber has never worked on batteries in his life. Period.

https://www.science.org/news/2020/02/why-did-chinese-university-hire-charles-lieber-do-battery-research

Charles Lieber’s actual specialty is bionanotechnology, the blending of living cells with non-living nanotech. For twenty years, he has been working with silicon nanowires, which are tiny, tiny structures thousands upon thousands of times thinner than a human hair, small enough to be engulfed and taken up by living cells.

https://spectrum.ieee.org/human-cells-eat-nanowires

He has promoted conductive silicon nanowires (particularly kinked field-effect transistor nanowires) as a replacement for messy, relatively gigantic patch clamp electrodes, to monitor and manipulate living cells. Which cells?

http://cml.harvard.edu/assets/Nanowire-probes-could-drive-high-resolution-brain-machine-interfaces.pdf

Brain-computer interfaces have been an ongoing topic of research for decades, from Jose Delgado’s primitive experiments with electrodes in the brains of bulls, to the Utah Array, to Neuralink, to various hypothetical future technologies that involve bionanotechnology and inserting neuralnanorobots into living brain tissue. Wireless nanotech is a promising method. After all, there are billions of neurons in people’s heads, and if you want the finest-grained mapping and control over a living brain, you would need individual electrodes in each neuron.

This is not science fiction. Elon Musk has demonstrated a working prototype of his Neuralink neural lace device, but that is as primitive and barbaric as trephination compared to some of the research being conducted with MIC think-tank funding. DARPA have invested heavily in brain-computer interfaces for soldiers, believing that soldiers of the future may control unmanned vehicles and drone assets like extensions of their own body, or even receive intel data piped directly into their brains with no lag and immediate comprehension. In other words, human enhancement is being treated as an unmet strategic need for the military.

You’re probably wondering what all this has to do with a virus, or vaccines, or any of that.

What if I told you that Charles Lieber was a colleague of Robert Langer, one of the co-founders of Moderna, and that they had co-written papers together?

What if I told you that Robert Langer’s own research deals not just with nanotech drug delivery, but also varying degrees of human enhancement through nanotechnology?

https://langerlab.mit.edu/

What if I told you that Klaus Schwab, the head of the WEF and the architect of the so-called “Great Reset”, had explicitly outlined a transhuman agenda in his books?

What if I told you that groups like La Quinta Columna and Japanese researchers are finding strange nanoparticle “contaminants” in vials of the COVID-19 vaccine?

So, I ask you again. Say you’re the Elites. Say you create a virus panic to get people hooked on a yearly injection of _something_, concocted by people who are closely associated with research into human enhancement and brain-computer interfaces. Why would you do this and what would your primary motivation be?

Fake U.S. Vaccination Cards - Legal or Illegal?

I've seen news reports stating fake vaccine cards are illegal.

From what I can tell, we're being misled or only told half the story. I can't find a law that says it's illegal to make a fake vaccination card for the purposes of entering businesses and public places. What appears to be illegal is to reproduce a government seal or to use fake documents to circumvent laws or government mandates, such as the mandatory quarantine period in Hawaii.

But if you make a fake card, tinker with the government seal so that it's not the real thing, and then try to use it to enter a restaurant or provide to an employer, is that a crime? What would be the crime? I don't think it's illegal to lie about your personal medical history as long as you don't violate a specific law in the process, and it appears everyone from news media to the FBI are lying and misleading people into thinking fake cards are flat out illegal.",2021-09-02 15:03:32

I do not work in an office. Such bullshit they are allowed to do this. I have a gf so this decision is not just mine. We are a team so it affects her, too.

And where does it stop? Are all the boosters going to be required? Does it ever end?

Now I can not even concentrate on work with all this racing through my head. How many more companies are going to go this route now that it has been FDA approved? I could find another job and be right back in this same spot. And starting my own job is not viable for me right now.

Who else has been in this situation and what did you do? My gf told me she will support my decision either way but when you subtract income streams in everyday households, shit will hit the fan and quick. I also read you can be denied unemployment if your termination/separation was Covid vaccine related. Not sure how true this is but nothing surprises me anymore.

It's getting real out there fellas. And this shit makes me sick. I am deathly afraid of this vaccine. No doctor can ease my mind as they do not know the long term side effects at all.

I am very healthy. I have not been sick one time during this. I eat healthy most of the time (a few splurge meals), I exercise and am active everday. I get natural Vitamind D. I get good sleep. I work from home. I do not need this shit!!

**Conclusions:**

Moderate-certainty evidence finds that large reductions in COVID-19 deaths are possible using ivermectin. Using ivermectin early in the clinical course may reduce numbers progressing to severe disease. The apparent safety and low cost suggest that ivermectin is likely to have a significant impact on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic globally.

They are hoping that we don't become suspicious of them, so they are in the lime light and telling us they are trying to help. The biggest issue with these types of crimes is that there is never concrete evidence. For example, you get the clot shot and get an ovarian cyst within 6 months, the doctor says well we don't know how long this cyst has been here so we can't conclusively say it's from the clot shot. Or you get the shot and develop a rare autoimmune disorder within 6 months and the doctor says well we don't know how that auto immune issue came about. That's how these evil people get away with what they are doing. The Nazi's and the Soviet's both created their own version of science to trick their societies.

It makes me think, [if you can persuade people, if what they see with their eyes is what there is to see](https://youtu.be/2frJ3e0hxPE), then they forget about the bigger picture.

Now I've been through every rabbit hole, every nook, every cranny. It all leads back to governments / rothschilds, but what if they too, bow to someone or something. A Physical thing.

Now in the video I linked above [""IM-Sama's Past Revealed: The Legendary High Priest | One Piece""](https://youtu.be/A0VSvwuKEgM), It talks about the One Piece being an empty sarcophagus of the alien that came down to the one piece world, performed miracles and became worshipped as god, then some saw past this ""diefication"" status and were wiped out. In one piece it's called the void century and the World Goverment just straight up erased 100 years of history because the D. Clan and the Will of D. was the Ancient Kingdom that rebelled ([Monkey D. Luffy, Monkey D. Garp, Gol D. Roger, Marshall D. Teach, etc.](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Will_of_D.)).

Do you think that the Rothschilds / Rockefellers really run the world or were they given that power by something or someone else?

Do you think we've had a ""void century"" or a giant war for freedom a long time ago or do you think we're coming towards making that void century in the next few decades?

Do you think our maps are what they say they are, or that they're hiding a lot more land then they say?

I googled the product to see if it was legit for this purpose and the search results came back with a lots of articles that either outright claimed it was successful or that tests were being conducted/looking promising as treatment. Multiple search pages of this... not a single negative article that I could see. A majority of these were all big news outlets too. Also worth noting, I'm not touching that shit whether someone says it works or not. I was just initially curious about stocks related to the product since trending stuff usually means green, hence why I searched.

Fast forward to this week. All of a sudden reddit is up in arms about misinformation. Admins/mods left and right protesting this, getting other subs banned over it. I end up looking up the product again... overwhelmingly negative search results this time.

Now why would google turn up good results one week and negative the next? Anyone else in here notice this as well? Was the news spreading misinformation all along, playing both sides of this dumpster fire?

Really sounds like this ""misinformation"" was just people voicing what they were reading on the news and then at the snap of a finger now they're all wrong and bad people because the news started preaching otherwise. Just another gas can on the fire to divide us and make us hate each other while the elite makes triple digit salaries for doing nothing in office til they die of old age.

I can't prove the positive search results as I didn't screenshot. I'm not asking anyone to believe me. I'm asking if you've personally saw the same things I have regarding the news singing a different tune.

Thanks, and be kind to one another regardless of your beliefs. Spread love friends.",2021-09-02 13:23:54

Totalitarianism and how the west lost the plot,10,pghsm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pghsm8/totalitarianism_and_how_the_west_lost_the_plot/,1,1630588941.0,"History gets taught in periods.. the longer ago something was the broader the period of time. So the Stone Age lasted a lot longer than the Iron Age and the Victorian period was a lot shorter than the the Ming Dynasty..

When we got to the 20th century things really accelerated. This is when we counted eras in decades. The roaring 20’s, the rock n roll 50’s, swinging 60’s etc. we pretty much had definable decades right up until the year 2000. The 90’s being the last decade that was noticeably different in terms of pop culture.

Since the internet became ubiquitous everything went to shit IMHO. It’s fragmented people so much that it seems to have caused stagnation in western culture. Rather than seeing a dominant new culture we just saw a gradual degeneration. 

On top of this, instead of creating a much more intelligence population, due to the abundance of information available at our fingertips..people just got dumber and dumber. In fact it’s not uncommon for people with a “smartphone” in hand to call out to or even text someone they know to answer a question??? This shit really happens.

It’s easier to ask someone else rather than to take a few minutes to search for the answer. This is how fucked people are now. Just imagine people with driverless cars..the cars could literally drive off a cliff and nobody would stop them because the car must know best!! 

For the last 20 years it’s as though civilization just stopped and started to implode.. 9/11 being the starting point.

Wokeness isn’t a culture it’s a rejection of culture. It’s like the maggots feeding on the carcass of culture. The west was already demoralized and out of ideas when wokeness took root. The feeble minded took pole position because nobody else could be bothered anymore.

Firstly I’d just like to say thank you for everyone who contributed over the years.  I personally gained unique perspectives on topics from the Kennedy assassination and MLK assassination,  to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, to some pretty shady political goings on in the US from BOTH major parties.   It was nice,  finding a space where mainstream American media and Wall Street talking points are not regurgitated and spit in your face every five seconds.  

Now that it looks like we are under fire.. I just would like to add…. If we do indeed get shut down,  take your ideas out into the world.   This doesn’t need to happen in the form of yelling, arguing, or belittling.   Perhaps start with something historically significant like the Kennedy assassination.  Build up to what is happening behind the scenes on Wall Street eventually.  

I’ve noticed a post about how it’s pretty well known the FBI played some part in the MLK assassination show up in ‘all’.   That’s pretty encouraging.   Although there is much to be frustrated about,  let’s focus on the truth,  and taking the truth offline and bringing it out into the world.

A quick search of his name and you can find it yourself, but seems like something happened. He’s winding down his tone in these little speeches. Went from speaking of revolutions to having “one loud voice”. Below is the is the post. 


“To all my followers,
It’s been a long week for me.  I plan to take the next week off of social media.  However, I felt compelled to make one final statement so that people aren’t overwhelming my inbox with questions over the next week.  

First, I am as good as can be expected.  My followers experienced a rollercoaster of emotions with me this last week.  All of your stories were comforting.  The empathy shown revived my belief in humanity and Americans.  I hope, when faced with perceived injustices, all Americans make the decision to always fight.  I believe warriors never quit.  I know I will never quit.  This situation, like all others before it, will only make me (us) stronger.  

Second, I want to clarify the purpose of this whole endeavor: accountability.  Without accountability, Marines (Americans) cannot heal and the Marine Corps (America) cannot evolve as an organization.  I must acknowledge that the rage escalated in my body very quickly, and perhaps my emotions didn’t always provide the rational clarity the situation required.  But maybe… every once in a while… a little rage is required too.  

Going forward at this point on my life’s path, I must remain committed to forcing accountability across our senior leaders.  I do not trust that reviews done by panels at the political/military level will bring the change we seek.  And I do not trust that it will change unless a strong enough force is applied to the system.  Major changes are needed.  The system needs to be broken and rebuilt.  We need fresh blood and perspective across the entire system.  Here’s a crazy idea to illustrate my point… what if we allowed the next EWS honor graduate to become the next Commandant?  If you say it’s not possible for a young, intelligent, charismatic leader to lead an organization such as the Marine Corps, then I’d say you haven’t been reviewing the history books you tell us to read.  If you say it’s not possible because that young officer can’t navigate the political landscape of DC… then I’d say you’re making the point for me.  It’s time for a new generation to assume American power.  We are ready, and we reject the current system.  

Third, this entire experience has illustrated to me just how hungry Americans are for honesty, accountability, and reform across the government.  This was expressed to me from ALL political parties.  We the people want change.  We the people WILL take it.  We the people are ALL Americans.

Follow me, and we will bring the whole fucking system down… in a constitutional manner with one loud voice.  

I respectfully ask all reporters, authors, friends, congressional offices, etc. to please also stop texting for the next week.  I need to unplug.

The book was written by George Orwell in 1948 and is set in, well, 1984. 

Some might see this as him just flipping the last two numbers on the year it was written, I thought this for the longest until I made a stark discovery. 

1984 - 1948 = 36

So we have the book set 36 years in the future from the year it was written. This is when and idea popped into my head ""what if I add 36 onto the year that the books set in"". 

1984 + 36 = 2020

Now by all means this is quite a reach but the correlations are quite apparent and I hope you understand how I have pieced this together, I don't even know if I'm the first to think of this either, I sure haven't heard it before. 

This is my theory that 1984 predicted that 2020 may be the beginning of a new surveillance and control era (were already in one but it will now show it's true face), and the similarities are already beginning to show and it's kind of surreal.

Been on Reddit for over 11 years (not this account ). 
It’s a shame because there are some legitimately cool communities here, the smaller more focused ones, but I can’t support this company anymore with my traffic. 

I like seeing friends post their pictures on FB/IG, but I can’t deal with the constant political discourse and the big brother feeling - posting fucking “misinformation “warnings over people’s photos if it’s not aligned 100% with the narrative. So gross. 

I’m gonna keep my smart phone for now because it’s necessary for work, but I may just eventually fuck off that too. As soon as they tell me I’ve gotta wear a mask again or try and coerce me into another vaccine (I got the first two, regrettably) “booster” I’m done there too. 
Thankfully I’m in a financial position where I can just hole up and plant a garden or Something. 

My wife is smart and mostly agrees with me, but I do fear that she’ll eventually succumb to the nonstop scare tactics. She even told me today she’ll “probably get the booster”, why ? Because it’s “easier “. 
She may eventually get sick of my kooky ways. Who knows.

There is a complete worldwide media blackout on these massive protests taking place around the globe. 

Is it just me, or have others noticed this as well > The American citizenry appears to be toothless cucked pussies vs. the French. Why is this? 

Military members are resigning because of the vaccine mandates. People are loosing their jobs. Loosing bodily autonomy. Loosing access to basic things. [EDIT]: In LA the rules being considered to require vaccination for grocery stores.  And everyone is okay with this? Why do I find that hard to believe? 

In France and Italy, a great many numbers of even those who are vaccinated are joining the protests to support and stand in solidarity with their unvaccinated brethren as one people of the nation. 

The only protests I've come across with decent crowd sizes in the US are happening in NYC. Are there others? 

I mean look at how many people are willing to show up for Trump. His rallies are massive. Also the election fraud protests were massive in number. w

Do Energy Drinks contain drugs?,0,pgfzeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgfzeb/do_energy_drinks_contain_drugs/,34,1630582206.0,"I have been wondering about this for sometime. We all know that they put fluoride in the water because it's an industrial byproduct and they have to dump it somewhere for the sake of ""ecology"" and ""recycling"". Whether it's healthy or not that is up for debate, but we know they re-use stuff and dump it directly on us. 

Hard drugs are banned worldwide but energy drinks are not, in fact it's an exponentially increasing trend. I go into a supermarket and I see guys fill up their whole carts with whole boxes of energy drinks, and the supermarket has like 2-3 isles of it dedicated now just to energy drinks. Seems like in the last 5-10 years or so people have been getting heavily addicted to them, especially very young guys, even teenagers.

I have been drinking them heavily too because it gives you so much energy and makes you feel good, but I am clean now for over 2 years now, because I realized that it's extremely unhealthy and it took me great effort to abandon it. I tried out one a few months ago just for nostalgia, but it tasted like garbage, now that I am not a regular drinker, it literally tastes like some radioactive water, it has a horrible taste, but when you are a regular user you don't feel it. So it's safe to say that I abandoned it.

It works basically like a hard drug, you drink it, the moment you swallowed it, the effect instantly kicks in, and you feel good for about 15 minutes, so you have to drink it constantly, sometimes I drank 3 cans a day, I was so addicted to it. Your eyes start to shine, your pupils dilate, and you get an extreme brain fog. For some time it makes you be able to concentrate better, this is why I drank it because I worked hard at the computer and it helped me focus, but after excessive use, it makes you feel tired, it messes with your sleep schedule, and then you are constantly tired due to it, forcing you to drink more. Not to mention next day you have a horrible hangover, bloodshot eyes, horrible headache, and your belly hurts after too much drinking. It takes like 2-3 days to fully clean it out from your system. Not to mention after excessive uses you become very paranoid, and OCD, speaking from experience, and I am not joking I literally got [sleep paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis) and started hearing voices while I was asleep.

It's basically the symptoms of fucking METH. And this was from a legally acquired energy drink brand (of which I am not going to mention) from the supermarket that small kids have access to, there isn't even an age barrier like with alcohol.

-

Now my question is, is it possible that they dose these drinks with actual fucking meth or other drugs? Is it possible that some of the drugs from the dark drug trade actually end up in them, as a slush fund to dump them onto gullible consumers. Because most people don't do outright street drugs, and I don't think the drug dealers end up selling all those thousands of tons of merchandise. We all know who runs the global drug trade anyway, and we know for a fact that Coca Cola once contained literal cocaine, so it's not out of the question for energy drink companies to add hard drugs to their recipe.",2021-09-02 11:30:06

Tretonin and the Lysine Contingency,3,pgfdog,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgfdog/tretonin_and_the_lysine_contingency/,13,1630579609.0,"For quite a while now my wife and I have both been trying very hard to understand why there is such a push, such propaganda from all over to get everyone to take these mRNA treatments for a virus that has a 99%+ survivability rate.  

We listened to a doctor make the point that at no time previously have any *vaccines* been promoted as a way to protect others, they are always promoted as a way to protect yourself.  In all my years I have to say she's right, I've never had anyone tell me to get vaccinated to save grandma, it was to protect myself.  The *side effect* of a vaccine that truly worked to prevent me getting sick would also keep me from spreading.  

But we know these current *vaccines* don't do that, they don't prevent infection, they don't reduce spread, at most they lighten symptoms.  

I, like most here, have read various thoughts on the forum of why there is such a push for the jab, one of the big ones being the folks saying the idea is population control, that the goal is long term reduction in population.  Could be, but that doesn't feel right.

We've seen the *elites* getting the jab, and I do believe many of them truly have.  And then there's the push to jab all members of the military, a group that has seen a total of [34 deaths](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2021/08/20/five-troops-including-first-marine-dead-from-covid-19-during-pandemics-deadliest-week/), 0.01% of the forces.  

Why would anyone want to eliminate their military?  Sure, there are those out there with the goal of eliminating the US, and all nations for that matter, and getting rid of the military would be necessary to do that, but I don't get that feeling from current crop of dictator wannabes.  They have to have the military to protect them.

Along with the blood clots and other issues, one of the side effects of the jab is called [ITP - Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura](https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/idiopathic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-itp) which is an unknown destruction of platelets in the blood.  This treatment is destroying a critical part of the bodies repair system.  

So why the push, what is behind it?  These treatments have never been used on people, they are still experimental.  I know there are shills claiming the mRNA therapies have been researched and studied for years, so if that is true, where are the studies of impacts on people?  Should be plenty of published reports, right?

We were watching the first Jurassic Park movie the other night and the scene in the lab where the geneticist talks about how the dinosaurs were engineered without the ability to produce the amino acid Lysine as a way to ensure they couldn't leave the island struck me.

Later I recalled from the Star Gate television series the episode about the planet that had a Goa'uld queen and had used her to create a drug, Tretonin, that suppressed and replaced the immune system.

After thinking through various reasons why there would be such a push to get people to take the jab, and now the talk about permanent boosters, these two shows make me think that perhaps this is the plan.  Consider what happens if the mRNA treatments do permanently impact the immune system, in order to not get sick people would have to continue receiving the boosters.  And who controls the boosters?

So why would the *elites* do this to themselves?  Because they aren't worried about not getting boosters, they control the distribution. 

Why would they do it to the military?  That one is easy, by making the military dependent on boosters to stay healthy, they now have control they never could have had before.  This is exactly what the Goa'uld did to the Jaffa but taking away their immune systems and making them have to be symbiote hosts to survive.  Is this a case of fantasy predicting the future or forward programming?

Same for the rest of the population - do what we say or we withhold your booster.  We know this level of control is something that certain groups have always wanted, it is one of the driving forces behind government controlled, single-payer health care.  And this entire plandemic, where States and Federal officials have banned off-label use of decades old drugs to treat the flu while pushing unproven mRNA therapies, shows they have no qualms about using an authority like that.

So for me, at least, this is the theory that makes the most sense.  And for those that aren't getting the jab, once they've locked the rest of the population into needing booster hits to survive, it wouldn't surprise me if TPB get more aggressive towards us and send their booster slaves after us.",2021-09-02 10:46:49

Ivermectin is claimed to be 86% effective against covid.  

And the one of the treatment protocol that is very effective is early intervention.  So, as soon as you are diagnosed with covid you are prescribed some ivermectin and you take it and hope to get better.  

This treatment protocol is an alternative to go home and wait until you turn blue and are rushed to hospital because you might die (what happens in Australia, not sure about other countries).  

So basically, instead of doing nothing at all you take ivermectin and hope for the best.    

Even if ivermectin was only 20% effective (which it isn't) isn't that a better alternative than doing nothing at all?  

Isn't it weird that our government isn't doing everything it can to help people dying from covid?  

Wouldn't you prefer a drug that may work rather than to try nothing at all?  You can still have your vax if you want but the truth is you can still die from covid even with the vax.  

But it's not like the government has ever done anything wrong in the past is it?  I mean the government has never ever been our friend in the past but for sure they are on our side this time.

Every 74th row had some bits that were set. The bits came in groups of four. They were simple characters, for sure, sixteen in total. Many people have said this proves that the aliens who built this machine have eight fingers on each hand. Sure, if they have two hands. But maybe they have four hands each with four fingers, or perhaps just a single, sixteen-fingered hand. It's all speculation if you ask me, probably prompted by the glove industry.

- a hijackers passport coincidentally being found at Ground Zero, somehow not burning through the plane crash, AND somehow not being torn apart by the building collpase - this one instance alone should be enough for everyone to fight for the truth about that day and days after.

I haven't gone to my sources this is just shit I remember off the top of my head from being obsessed with trying to decipher truth from lies admist all the 9/11 information over the years.

How millions of people don't want to or are just ignorant to seeking truth disgusts me.

We have one life, the least we can do for humanity is fight for the truth and fight against all instances of censorship, propaganda and the like

With the 20 year anniversary coming up and the situation in Afghanistan, I predict a bloody month.

I hope I'm wrong, for humanity's sake

"Did Gematria originate from Kabbalistic teachings which some would argue is black magic/demonic, or is it the blueprint and source code for creation divinely created by the creator?",4,pgdyis,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgdyis/did_gematria_originate_from_kabbalistic_teachings/,6,1630572647.0,"Can anyone tell me where Gematria truly originated? From what I can gather it originates from Kabbalistic teachings which in my opinion is demonic, black magic, and witchcraft. It probably stems back to the fallen angels of Enochs day who taught mankind forbidden knowledge and the secrets of heaven after they were banished from earth by the creator for rebelling with lucifer against the most high. 

That being said, a part of me thinks Gematria could be the actual blueprint for creation it’s self. The divine source code. As most of you will know, numbers and letters hold a specific energy/vibrations. When combined those new numbers/words create new energies/vibrations which give them a purpose/meaning. 

The elite/fallen realm use Gematria to harness the energy of the words/numbers to perpetuate their evil agendas. Through free will and intention they harness the energies for negative purposes or black magic. 

So the question needs to be asked, was Gematria created by the fallen realm (fallen angels and demons) to be specifically used for black magic to spiritually assist the illuminati to take over mankind? 

Or was Gematria always here and is the actual blueprint and the source code for creation itself? If so this would mean the elite have just hijacked Gematria and they are using it through free will and intention for black magic to take over humanity. 

Can Gematria be utilised for good? Or for a positive impact to assist mankind? Or is it purely black magic and witchcraft? I see a lot of people decoding Gematria used by the elite but I never see people “encoding” it for good? Can it even be encoded for good? Or is it purely black magic?

There were quite a few channels back in the day during the earlier years of Youtube that would post conspiracy compilations.

There was something about them that gave off all sorts of uncanny valley vibes. They are similar, if not the same in physical appearance, to the Men in Black that many report seeing after UFO encounters.

Usually men in suits, completely bald and clean-shaven. Some wear hats. Most are just bald, with sharp, odd features, with a lack of eyebrows, similar to those with alopecia. But as I said. Uncanny valley vibes. They have been reported to ""shapeshift"", too and some even refer to them as ""reptilian shapeshifters"".

Anyway, it was a compilation of all these sorts of men, with zoomed-in shots of them seeming to ""shapeshift"". A lot of the shots were from when Bush was president, right through to when Obama was. But the specific video I'm searching for was when Bush was president and wasn't acting quite right, whether it be from his dementia, or from some sort of mind control, I'm not sure. But I know when this was happening, these men were seen frequently.

I had a feeling this day would come. I have until the 14th to fight my case or pay the piper. So many red flags, as some of us know and see. I am writing this post to see if I can be proven wrong with the things that I am concerned about this shot. I once was a believer that the government had my back to only see it just to be smoke in the mirror. But, after experiencing 9 years of bullshit that the government and military has done to me and my fellow Active Duty,  I have lost the trust and confidence in all politicians and no long want or need any government help.

So much bullshit and lack of transparency with this whole thing in general. How all of this is just being shoved down our throats, bribed, faked, and overall division that this has created. What I fear most about all this is why and what the end goal might be for the ones calling the shots. It just baffles me that this is the reality of things.

Tomorrow I am going to stand my ground and find out my options. I only have 3 months left in the service so at this point, this is the only ammo I have.

Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. With or against my opinion.

I hope I am wrong. I really do.

EDIT: So just to be clear, this refusal isn't from ""being microchipped"" or ""mind-control"" or the famous ""God will protect me"". (Being religious myself, there is a fine line on what the Gods have done, and what humans has done).

I do believe the virus is real. I do believe in science.

The lack of transparency and the unknown side effect of the long term exposure to such. You feel fine now, but what could happen in the years to come? That's where my lack of trust of the shot stems from. Prime example is the anthrax shot back in '01.Where the military were the test subjects, being forced the take the shot only to find out that it wasn't safe and ruined peoples lives. Ones that were forced out, or took the shot to stay in.

I am sure there are plenty of other examples, this is just the one that stuck out.",2021-09-02 05:58:40

The Real Reasons Ivermectin is Being Supressed,177,pgbcy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pgbcy8/the_real_reasons_ivermectin_is_being_supressed/,103,1630559886.0,"The fact that we're seeing every major news outlet, plus countless bots, sheep, and paid shills go to war on Ivermectin, a drug which has seen widespread use since the 1980's, clearly indicated that the compound presents a danger to the establishment. The reasons the drug is now being attacked with everything from media hit campaigns, to fear/shock tactics, to normie subreddits protesting for censorship, to images of horse cocks, has deeper roots than just the drugs effectiveness at treating the symptoms of covid-19.



Ivermectin is cheap to manufacture and widely available in many countries, especially those near the equator. It is a miracle drug to many in tropical regions where parasitic and viral infections are most common. Beyond being able to compete with mRNA therapuetics as a viable covid treatment, (which conveniently would render Emergency Use Authorization impossible under federal regulations), Ivermectin has been shown to be a promising candidate in the treatment of many other diseases. Examples of these include epilepsy, HIV, cancer, asthma, malaria, schistosomiasis, and others.



A drug like Ivermectin, if allowed to become widely used in the west, could topple the multi-billion dollar pharmaceuticals industy overnight. Remember that it's not just the money! The pharmaceutical market is necessary to keep the population sick, poor, and docile.

I live in Southeast Louisiana and we just got slammed by one of the most powerful storms to ever make landfall. Not sure how CNN or Fox News is making it out to be since we don’t have any service (currently at a family member’s house away from the damage) but this storm was bad. We’re talking worse than Katrina. A local ship captain clocked wind speeds at 172mph, the strongest ever recorded. Entire parishes wiped off the face of the earth, power outages expected to last for a month, and gas supplies dwindling. New Orleans is an absolute shitshow right now with no end in sight. They dodged a major bullet since the levees held (Corps actually got something right). Anyways I digress, back to the people. 

The people in south Louisiana are a special kind of people, resilient in the face of destruction. I live in the suburbs of NOLA and everywhere you look you see utter destruction. Homes gone. Schools gone. Hospitals barely hanging on. But all around those places are people. People with smiles. People who understand. People who want to help. They don’t care what color your skin is, whether or not you’re vaccinated or who you voted for. Chances are these people lost everything just like you and are battling the same battles. Extension cords cross the streets underneath the utility company’s lines so neighbors can share their generators with those who don’t have any. Restaurants opening up just to cook all their food and give it away to those who are hungry. Whole blocks gathering and cooking all their meats so they won’t go to waste. 

It’s truly something to experience a life-altering hurricane. It feels like everything has reset. I feel like I’m in a community that cares. No politics are discussed and covid fear is looooong gone. I almost wish it could be like this forever. The time spent with family and friends circled around a lantern drinking and eating is humbling and peaceful. My friendships have gone stronger, my love for my community has grown stronger, and most importantly, my hope for humanity has grown stronger.

Ask your neighbor if he wants a cold beer.

Canada - The Liberals and the Green Party are committing political suicide to bring NDP to power,5,pg94pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pg94pg/canada_the_liberals_and_the_green_party_are/,18,1630551089.0,"The liberals have effectively committed political suicide - Calling a surprise election during a health crises they messed up, with no announced platform is political suicide... people still talking about the liberals are akin to poking a dead body with a stick to see if its still alive. They are trending downward, and who couldn't have seen it coming?

Then there's the Green party, who's also committing political suicide: Talking about Zionists, not a single candidate in NL, Anna doesn't even know anyone by name, endless drama, etc... They are effectively pushing their base towards the NDP as well. Most left leaning voters would rather vote anyone other than a conservative - It's basic common sense to see where stranded Green & Liberal party voters will go.

The NDP are getting the Lib/NDP voting pool tilted in their direction. Most NDP voters in 2015 voted Liberal to get Harper out, and now Liberal voters are moving to the NDP side in spite of Trudeau. This, plus the NDP's pandering to the ever increasing population of students and immigrants - their target audience is massive, critical mass achieved. It doesn't matter that the NDP are in essence the same as the Liberals and will keep going down the same path. They all voted 100% for bill c10 anyways, so quelle surprise - Leftwing birds of a feather flock together appearently

If 2020/2021 tells us anything , its that most NA mainstream media companies will give Trudeau and Biden a free pass, and unflinchingly support their mandated narratives leaders (Border closures for Covid are xenophobic, mentioning the Wuhan lab leak theory as a cancelable offense for scientists/journalists), while stomping out any right leaning viewpoint. That is to say, the media will champion the winning narrative for the NDP.. and here's a little foreshadowing for you - https://www.google.com/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/8145113/canada-election-ipsos-leadership-singh/amp/

Journalistic integrity shot out the window and instead is in alignment with the clear left leaning motives of the government, so I can't help but think there's an effort to shift liberal voters onto the NDP side. I'm an agnostic centrist, I've voted liberal & green in the past, but the constant overriding of democracy isn't Canadian. This is a clear movement to bring NDP to power this year, or at least gain minority government for further expansion in the future, where all floodgates will continue to push in their direction.

Not a lab.

\- There are no side effects to the vaccine.

\- Get the vaccine it's 90% - 95% safe and effective depending on the manufacturer.

\- Don't forget to get the second dose.

\- Ivermectin is to deworm horses.

\- VAERS is a list full of non-credible liars from America's enemies who don't want Americans to get the vaccine.

\- There is no evidence hydrocortisone ever worked.

\- Wear a mask! You wouldn't drive a car without a seat belt!

\- Kids should wear masks at school too, because even children have lungs. Safety first!

\- Vaccine passports are for our safety.

\- Hospitals are overwhelmed. ICU beds are filling. That's why last year that hospital ship was called in and several large cities constructed hospital tents inside arenas at the cost of millions of dollars to handle the overflow.

\- Hospitals have to send people to different states because they are so full.

\- More police have died last year from covid than crime.

\- 3,600 nurses have died of covid

\- Prisons released prisoners, because no one would expect a law breaker to keep a mask on.

\- The rare instances where people could stick a magnet onto their arm is just laughable and a hoax. You would need a lot of metal in your blood stream for that to really happen. There is no metal in the vaccine.

\- Covid non believers always seem to die. Look at the 3 radio hosts and viral sensations that have just died in the past month.

\- 1.3k Americans are dying per day from covid, which is 2x worse than this time last year.

\- 150k new cases per day, making it 4x as contagious as this time last year, proving we should never have unmasked.

\- China has wiped out covid. Less than 100 new cases per day in a country of 1.4 billion. Let's be more like them.

\- The flu is gone because people socially distanced last flu season and masks work.

\- While break through cases happen, they are rare and side effects are less severe than not having the vaccine. Break through cases being the term for you still get the virus.

\- Trying to understand the data, means you'll probably get it wrong, and that's why news broadcasts bring experts with actual degrees.

\- Does your high school friend on Facebook have a degree in virology?

\- Just because you're asymptomatic doesn't mean you won't spread it to someone's grand mother who can't get the vaccine due to medical reasons. Her death will be on your hands.

\- Be kind to others, and remember that every time you don't mask and don't vaccine, you're stripping away someone else's freedom.

\- It's just a mask and not a Hazmat suit. It's not too much to ask you to wear a mask is it? You'll be fine.

\- We are in this together.

"McAfee files - Lets figure this out, okay?",95,pg8qon,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pg8qon/mcafee_files_lets_figure_this_out_okay/,58,1630549655.0,"Okay guys - lets try something here

I'm sure most of you know about the McAfee dead-man switch thing, it's been posted here plenty of times, but so far nothing has come of it (That I know of).

If you're one of those people who is disillusioned, or doesn't believe, or thinks it's a nothing burger, then go look elsewhere, okay? Don't waste your time posting your negative comments, just let people look into this and see if we can figure this stuff out.

Now - most of you have probably seen the TM feed for McAfee afterlife - link here - [https://t.me/s/McafeeAfterlife](https://t.me/s/McafeeAfterlife) (Edit - *I should warn that there are some potentially disturbing images on this feed - if you have not looked before and are faint-of-heart, or easily shocked, then this may not be for you - just a heads-up*)

Also, I have seen a link to where these McAfee files are supposed to be stored - link here -  [https://cryptpad.fr/drive/#/2/drive/view/G+83I7JiOToddretjlv+gVIB40dc8VgfFWkoroJBlMM/p/](https://cryptpad.fr/drive/#/2/drive/view/G+83I7JiOToddretjlv+gVIB40dc8VgfFWkoroJBlMM/p/)

This link takes you to a folder location that requires a password to access. The McAfee afterlife TM feed provides the following:

On August 8th at 12.17 -  \*4FNpjM\*

On August 9th at 02.56 - #si8qUHw

On Augst 29th at 07.30 - iv5BbDuL

Put these all together and you get  \*4FNpjM\*#si8qUHwiv5BbDuL - this code gives you access to the main folder, which shows you 5 new subfolders - all of which require a password.

On August 29th, there was a post at 10.44 that contains the following:

**I have Unlocked the Vault to the deadliest switch you can imagine 31+ terabytes of the most incriminating data will be released to the Public WorldWide. . .**

**All Keys have been provided in my Channel:It is up to You to Look for the Truth:**

&#x200B;

So - according to the above, the keys are already there, waiting to be found, we just have to figure it out and locate them.

I hate to break this to you, but it doesn't look like anyone is coming to help us anytime soon. Even if it looks like some talking heads are on our side, or some groups are doing stuff to help, do we really know it for sure, or is it all part of the illusion?

So unless you have something much better to do - why not try and help look at this? You don't necessarily need to be a tech genius, although it may help!

So, first up we are looking for 5 passwords - thats our first clue. Maybe there's something on that feed that appears in a group of 5 - it could be an indicator of a lead.

Something did occur to me - the first password was given to us in 3 segments. Let's refer to those segments as 1, 2 and 3. These can be rearranged in 6 different combinations, as follows:

123

132

213

231

312

321

We already used the first sequence, 123, to get access to the first folder - which leaves 5 combinations. Naturally, I thought this may be important, so trying to rearrange them in the other orders might get access to the other 5 folders.

Sadly, I'm pretty sure I've tried each combination for the other folders, but without any success, so it seems that might be a dead-end. But perhaps it's worth trying them back to front, or some other way? Who knows.

So here's something else I noticed. Even if you're not a tech genius, hopefully this will make logical sense.

On the McAfee afterlife TM, the most recent post is a picture with some code posted on August 31st, at 07.17.

On the very left side of the image, there is a column of numbers, 8 digits:

00000000

00000010

00000020

etc, etc

These represent lines of information.

The middle of the picture, you have 16 pairs of 2 digit numbers. These are hexadecimal code.

Lets take the 10th line as an example (00000090) - 4A 61 6E 2F 32 30 30 39

If you take these codes, and put them into a hexadecimal converter, you can get the text output, in this case **Jan/2009** \- which is the information on the right-hand side of the image.

Links to Hexadecimal converters here:

[https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html)

[http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/hexadecimal/#data](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/hexadecimal/#data)

The first link seems to work better for me. The second one tends to return a lot of useless symbols, either plain squares, or weird question marks, which look incorrect. But perhaps this is still useful, perhaps we should be filtering out those symbols?

Or maybe the first converter is better. I don't know.

For some reason neither of them seem to return a full stop when you enter either 00 or 01, and I don't know if this is significant either - so if anyone knows a better converter, or a reason for this, your input could be helpful.

So the above is basically something to try - there's a lot of weird code stuff on the McAfee TM feed, so maybe playing around with it or converting it will lead to the passwords for the folders. He does say that they are provided in the channel, so where's the harm in trying to figure them out? Worst case scenario, you may waste an hour or two, but at least you tried to do something useful, right?

If you do manage to figure it out, then share it. Or if you have any useful input, or suggestions, put them in the comments.

Maybe the hexadecimal converter will lead to something. Maybe rearranging those 3 segments, or playing around with them will lead to something.

The more people who try, the more chance there is someone will crack it. Good luck!",2021-09-02 02:27:35

Theory: The Powers that be moving towards a collapse and great reset are using this complete fuckup in Afghanistan as only one, premeditated step in the process. Biden didn’t want to run in 2016 and even then showed signs of cognitive impairment, but somehow this was the guy they knew they wanted to replace Trump and obliviously crumble  the US from the inside. They knew they could use Biden as a fall guy for his perceived weakness and mental deterioration where a more competent president would make it apparent that this was a plan because of how ass-backwards everything has played out. Yes, Trump was going to leave Afghanistan, but the plan in place was no where as hastily and recklessly drawn as this. They have now taken from the US and given to enemies billions of dollars worth of equipment, intelligence, networks, and infrastructure (most likely China will be on the receiving end of Taliban trades, Russia could get some of those arms as well). Biden was pushed by the DNC and media coverups from 2018 to now, all throughout his campaign (including the nearly complete blackout where he wasn’t to be seen or heard) and then once he was installed to now where the media is finally turning on him for carrying this out. 

Biden is only one piece of the puzzle. Aside from him, they’ve now weakened the economic structure, cohesiveness, and spirit of societies worldwide; shifted trillions of dollars worth of wealth to the already wealthy and destroy the middle class and opportunities for upward mobility; destabilized the supply chain so access to resources is not readily available; and increased surveillance to monitor any dissent and encourage people to oust each other.

Below is the full text of the announcement.

[COVID denialism and policy clarifications](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pg006s/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/)

>“Happy” Wednesday everyone

>As u/spez mentioned in his [announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/) last week, COVID has been hard on all of us. It will likely go down as one of the most defining periods of our generation. Many of us have lost loved ones to the virus. It has caused confusion, fear, frustration, and served to further divide us. It is my job to oversee the enforcement of our policies on the platform. I’ve never professed to be perfect at this. Our policies, and how we enforce them, evolve with time. We base these evolutions on two things: user trends and data. Last year, after we rolled out [the largest policy change in Reddit’s history](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/), I shared a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/idclo1/understanding_hate_on_reddit_and_the_impact_of/) on the prevalence of hateful content on the platform. Today, many of our users are telling us that they are confused and even frustrated with our handling of COVID denial content on the platform, so it seemed like the right time for us to share some data around the topic. 

>*Analysis of Covid Denial*

>We sought to answer the following questions:

>* How often is this content submitted?
>* What is the community reception?
>* Where are the concentration centers for this content?

>Below is a chart of all of the COVID-related content that has been posted on the platform since January 1, 2020. We are using common keywords and known COVID focused communities to measure this. The volume has been relatively flat since mid last year, but since July (coinciding with the increased prevalence of the Delta variant), we have seen a sizable increase. 

>[COVID Content Submissions](https://preview.redd.it/5draikoecxk71.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=4aa9a815e3b8637ad2c8f1a654b1b5f82cac4d97)

>The trend is even more notable when we look at COVID-related content reported to us by users. Since August, we see approximately 2.5k reports/day vs an average of around 500 reports/day a year ago. This is approximately 2.5% of all COVID related content. 

>[Reports on COVID Content](https://preview.redd.it/v35d5wfgcxk71.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6604d4fae70f04ba0cbf5beb3949aab5169fc99)

>While this data alone does not tell us that COVID denial content on the platform is increasing, it is certainly an indicator. To help make this story more clear, we looked into potential networks of denial communities. There are some well known subreddits dedicated to discussing and challenging the policy response to COVID, and we used this as a basis to identify other similar subreddits. I’ll refer to these as “high signal subs.”

>Last year, we saw that less than 1% of COVID content came from these high signal subs, today we see that it's over 3%. COVID content in these communities is around 3x more likely to be reported than in other communities (this is fairly consistent over the last year). Together with information above we can infer that there has been an increase in COVID denial content on the platform, and that increase has been more pronounced since July. While the increase is suboptimal, it is noteworthy that the large majority of the content is outside of these COVID denial subreddits. It’s also hard to put an exact number on the increase or the overall volume. 

>An important part of our moderation structure is the community members themselves. How are users responding to COVID-related posts? How much visibility do they have? Is there a difference in the response in these high signal subs than the rest of Reddit?

>High Signal Subs

>* Content positively received - 48% on posts, 43% on comments
>* Median exposure - 119 viewers on posts, 100 viewers on comments
>* Median vote count - 21 on posts, 5 on comments

>All Other Subs

>* Content positively received - 27% on posts, 41% on comments
>* Median exposure - 24 viewers on posts, 100 viewers on comments
>* Median vote count - 10 on posts, 6 on comments

>This tells us that in these high signal subs, there is generally less of the critical feedback mechanism than we would expect to see in other non-denial based subreddits, which leads to content in these communities being more visible than the typical COVID post in other subreddits. 

>*Interference Analysis*

>In addition to this, we have also been investigating the claims around targeted interference by some of these subreddits. While we want to be a place where people can explore unpopular views, it is never acceptable to interfere with other communities. Claims of “brigading” are common and often hard to quantify. However, in this case, we found very clear signals indicating that r/NoNewNormal was the source of around 80 brigades in the last 30 days (largely directed at communities with more mainstream views on COVID or location-based communities that have been discussing COVID restrictions). This behavior continued even after a warning was issued from our team to the Mods. r/NoNewNormal is the only subreddit in our list of high signal subs where we have identified this behavior and it is one of the largest sources of community interference we surfaced as part of this work (we will be investigating a few other unrelated subreddits as well). 

>*Analysis into Action*

>We are taking several actions:

>1. Ban r/NoNewNormal immediately for breaking our rules against brigading
>2. Quarantine 54 additional COVID denial subreddits under [Rule 1](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)
>3. Build a new reporting feature for moderators to allow them to better provide us signal when they see community interference. It >will take us a few days to get this built, and we will subsequently evaluate the usefulness of this feature. 

>*Clarifying our Policies*

>We also hear the feedback that our policies are not clear around our handling of health misinformation. To address this, we wanted to provide a summary of our current approach to misinformation/disinformation in our [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). 

>Our approach is broken out into (1) how we deal with health misinformation (falsifiable health related information that is disseminated regardless of intent), (2) health disinformation (falsifiable health information that is disseminated with an intent to mislead), (3) problematic subreddits that pose misinformation risks, and (4) problematic users who invade other subreddits to “debate” topics unrelated to the wants/needs of that community. 

>1. Health Misinformation. We have long interpreted our rule against posting content that “encourages” physical harm, in this [help center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513151), as covering health misinformation, meaning falsifiable health information that encourages or poses a significant risk of physical harm to the reader. For example, a post pushing a verifiably false “cure” for cancer that would actually result in harm to people would violate our policies.  

>2. Health Disinformation. Our rule against impersonation, as described in this [help center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043075032), extends to “manipulated content presented to mislead.” We have interpreted this rule as covering health disinformation, meaning falsifiable health information that has been manipulated and presented to mislead. This includes falsified medical data and faked WHO/CDC advice.  

>3. Problematic subreddits.  We have long applied [quarantine](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043069012) to communities that warrant additional scrutiny. The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed or viewed without appropriate context. 

>4. Community Interference. Also relevant to the discussion of the activities of problematic subreddits, [Rule 2](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) forbids users or communities from “cheating” or engaging in “content manipulation” or otherwise interfering with or disrupting Reddit communities.  We have interpreted this rule as forbidding communities from manipulating the platform, creating inauthentic conversations, and picking fights with other communities. We typically enforce Rule 2 through our anti-brigading efforts, although it is still an example of bad behavior that has led to bans of a variety of subreddits.

>As I mentioned at the start, we never claim to be perfect at these things but our goal is to constantly evolve. These prevalence studies are helpful for evolving our thinking. We also need to evolve how we communicate our policy and enforcement decisions. As always, I will stick around to answer your questions and will also be joined by u/traceroo our GC and head of policy.",2021-09-02 00:59:47

I'm sure a lot of you have seen this already.

Some of us older conspiracy guys can remember that there's been a theory floating around saying that the elites want to encourage depopulation of the masses in order to make the world more manageable and comfortable.  Think Thanos but in real life.

Depopulation Theory:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pf72ma/global\_depopulation\_agenda\_proof/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pf72ma/global_depopulation_agenda_proof/)

Above are some previous posts about depopulation.

It's looking like the anti-mask movement really fits into this theory.  We've got a virus that's killing a lot of folks, and then we got some strange new news sources pumping out information that supports the following claims:

\- The virus doesn't kill that many people.  Don't focus on the spread rate or other things about the virus.  Just focus on the death rate.

\- Masks don't help.  In fact, they make things worse or are actively promoting your eventual slavery (huh?)

\- The vaccine will kill you/sterlize you/ etc.

\- Random drugs will save you while providing very little evidence.

&#x200B;

Look who's promoting all these anti-mask/vaccine theories.  Dudes that most of us would consider as the ELITES:

ROBERT F KENNEDY JR - Disgraced lawyer and son of Robert F Kennedy. Old money, sits with the illuminati.

Could it be that Bill Gates (or whoever, just going with the major conspiracies) actually engineered a virus and made it kill just so many that a certain demographic willingly opts out of life saving measures and essentially commits suicide?

What if it is a conspiracy by the elite to get rid of the very people that are now dying the most? The anti mask, anti vax, anti social distancing - what if they are the actual target all along? 
Maybe it is the reckoning engineered by scientist getting rid of the ones not willing to learn.

Wouldn’t it be genius if that was their real plan and everyone participated as predicted? One side wears masks, adapts, overcomes, and is spared, one side fights common sense, science and ultimately dies.

If you think, as a lot of conspiracies say, Bill Gates **made** the virus - would you think he would kill everyone or would he rather target his enemy, the classic arrogant loud bully, someone he would have dealt with a lot as a computer nerd in his youth.

I would believe this conspiracy a lot more than the other way around. 

… and the current numbers would proof this to be at least partially true.

Trump loses the election and Biden takes office with only a few months to figure out how to remove the troops without it being a disaster. This makes Biden and the democratic party look foolish and inept.

However, in this case, we found very clear signals indicating that r/NoNewNormal was the source of around 80 brigades in the last 30 days (largely directed at communities with more mainstream views on COVID or location-based communities that have been discussing COVID restrictions). This behavior continued even after a warning was issued from our team to the Mods. r/NoNewNormal is the only subreddit in our list of high signal subs where we have identified this behavior and it is one of the largest sources of community interference we surfaced as part of this work (we will be investigating a few other unrelated subreddits as well).

Now before I get attacked, I am left-leaning as I don't care for religion, old world close-mindedness, and the belief that ""life was better then"". BUT, I also believe that classical philosophies are applicable to, and are beneficial for, everyone's daily life.

I am just amazed at how people in this sub are more concerned about which side of the political spectrum is to blame, when both sides are just faces of the same coin. From the minds of the creators of South Park, the USA, and most other democratic countries, are ""a little bit country, and a little bit rock & roll"". Can we all just get together and actually oppose the true enemy of FREEDOM? And that enemy is the Chinese Communist Party.

The Chinese Communist Party is literally an organized crime syndicate, responsible for illegal infrastructures in foreign countries, illegal detentions, mass illegal fishing outside their oceanic borders, kidnappings, rape, murders, slander, re-writing history, cultural and actual genocide of Tibetans, Uyghurs, and Mongolians, constant attempt at invading the free and democratic country of Taiwan, and also blocking Taiwan from joining the WHO, infiltrating the UN and the EU, infiltrating Hollywood and mass media in general, infiltrating social media (hello to the Wumaos reading this post), supporting other authoritarian, and communist regimes (Myanmar, Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, etc.), supporting terrorists (Hezbollah, ISIL, Taliban, etc.), mass surveillance, bribing foreign politicians, technology transfers (stealing intellectual properties), mass hackings, the list goes on. No government should look to their leadership for anything. IN FACT, all other governments should band together to get rid of the Chinese Communist Party.

All these, plus the likelihood that COVID-19 was probably developed from a Chinese Communist Party backed bio-lab, and the cover up that they did when it first spread was the reason why it became a pandemic in the first place. They also bribed the shit out the World Health Organization, that's why everything turned to crap-custard.

So please, if there are political conspiracies that should have air-time in this sub, they should be about the malignant actions of the Chinese Communist Party against free and democratic countries.

2. At least 20% of the population has strong authoritarian tendencies, which will emerge under the right conditions.
3. Fear of death is only rivaled by the fear of social disapproval. The latter could be stronger.
4. Propaganda is just as effective in the modern day as it was 100 years ago. Access to limitless information has not made the average person any wiser.
5. Anything and everything can and will be politicized by the media, government, and those who trust them.
6. Many politicians and large corporations will gladly sacrifice human lives if it is conducive to their political and financial aspirations.
7. Most people believe the government acts in the best interests of the people. Even many who are vocal critics of the government.
8. Once they have made up their mind, most people would rather to double down than admit they were wrong.
9. Humans can be trained and conditioned quickly and relatively easily to significantly alter their behaviors -- for better or worse.
10. When sufficiently frightened, most people will not only accept authoritarianism but demand it.
11. People who are dismissed as ""conspiracy theorists"" are often well researched and simply ahead of the mainstream narrative.
12. Most people value safety and security more than freedom and liberty, even if said ""safety"" is merely an illusion.
13. Hedonic adaptation occurs in both directions, and once inertia sets in, it is difficult to get people back to ""normal.""
14. A significant % of people thoroughly enjoy being subjugated.
15. ""The Science"" has evolved into a secular pseudo-religion for millions of people in the West. This religion has little to do with truth.
16. Most people care more about looking like they are doing the right thing, rather than actually doing the right thing.
17. Politics, the media, science, and the healthcare industries are all corrupt, to varying degrees. Scientists and doctors can be bought as easily as politicians.
18. If you make people comfortable enough, they will not revolt. You can keep millions docile as you strip their rights, by giving them money, food, and entertainment.
19. Modern people are overly complacent and lack vigilance when it comes to defending their own freedoms from government overreach.
20. It's easier to fool a people than to convince them they have been fooled.

Government Imposed Medical Treatment,0,pg582p,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pg582p/government_imposed_medical_treatment/,2,1630537164.0,"The constitution and bill of rights of the U.S. were created to protect people from an authoritarian, dictatorial, and/or tyrannical government. This includes the right to speak, assemble, bear arms, resist self-implication, equitable burden, and equal taxation.

The government can require of its workers whatever it requires, generally. This is the ""sign your life away"" aspect of military service, especially, but is not inapplicable to government jobs more generally.

But most of us agree - and our history as a country bears witness to the sentiment - that there is a line to draw when it comes to the government directing private business. Yes, we need rules. We need to guarantee basic constitutional rights in regard to employment and discrimination, we need to have tax regulations and safety standards and fair labor practices. There is a role for government when it comes to how business is run. But meddling in the private health decisions of employees is a line. Think of insurance companies and preexisting conditions, or any job and disability accommodations.

When it comes to vaccines, supposedly [the feds] [can only require them to prevent transmission of a dangerous infectious disease across state lines or international borders](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vaccine-mandates-are-lawful-effective-and-based-on-rock-solid-science/).

By mandating a vaccine requirement in order for institutions to be eligible for federal funds, the government is exploiting a loophole to impose its own will upon private businesses without true authority. They're not wrong in their implementation, but the problem is that they are finding a way to make a wrong thing ""right"". It's an imposition.

Since many long-term care facilities rely on federal funding, the choice is essentially nonexistent: mandate the COVID shot regardless of how you think your business should be run (edit: and regardless of facility-specific data, needs, and risk assessment), or lose the money that you rely upon to serve the public good.

This will affect some of the poorest and most disenfranchised people in our country by giving them no real choice between having a job and maintaining their personal medical autonomy. It's an overreach of government and deserves the scrutiny of the Public, regardless of individual stances regarding COVID shots or any other medical treatment. Dangerous precedent, imo.

&#x200B;

The current Covid19 vaccines have several problems. I would say that there are 9 main areas of interest:

&#x200B;

the spike protein appears to be cytotoxic.

&#x200B;

the emergence of immune escape variants.

&#x200B;

the potential for antibody dependent enhancement.

&#x200B;

the potential for autoimmune disorders.

&#x200B;

the narrow design focus of the vaccines.

&#x200B;

the fact that alternative treatments are available to both prevent and treat covid.

&#x200B;

they are trying to jab everyone, even people who have recovered from covid and do not need the jab.

&#x200B;

there are a growing number of severe reactions to the vaccines but this fact gets very little coverage in the press and sometimes it even gets outright censorship.

&#x200B;

the potential for long term unknown side effects and the potential impact of this on national security.

&#x200B;

I will present a brief overview of each issue and then provide scientific data below for support (except for 9. which is more a discussion based on a logical assessment of future risk).

&#x200B;

1. The spike protein of the virus, that is also being utilized in the vaccines, is damaging to our cells through 3 mechanisms. The first is that when the spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor it causes the ACE2 to send signals to the mitochondria within the cell which destroys the mitochondria, eventually killing the cell. The second is that when the spike protein binds to our ACE2 receptors it causes the ACE2 to send signals to other cells which increases the amount of pro-inflammatory agents in the blood. This inflammation damages the tissues. The third way is that when the spike protein binds to the ACE2 of the platelets in our blood, it causes them to clot. Now, the vaccine manufacturers did take steps to make the spike protein more safe. The spike protein has two parts an S1 subunit and an S2 subunit. The S1 is the part that connects to the ACE2, and the S2 is the part that opens up like a knife stabbing the membrane and facilitates fusion between the membrane of the cell and the envelope of the virus. With the vaccines, they modified the S2 subnit so that it could not open up and jab into the cell membranes if it connects with any ACE2 receptors. They thought this would make the spike protein safe, but this assumption is false and if they had taken the time to do more research before rushing to production they would have found that out. It may seem like the jabby bit is what damages the cells, but actually the major damage is caused by the S1 connecting to the ACE2 receptor. Just the S1, by itself without the S2, causes the ACE2 receptor to start the cell signaling processes that cause the mitochondrial damage, the pro-inflammatory response, and the blood clots.

Addendum to the above link. This blog post provides easy to understand information (with pictures) on the make-up of the lipid nanoparticles used in the Covid19 vaccines. It shows that the pharmaceutical companies could have designed them to have targeting ligands on the outside, so that the nanoparticles would only transfect the muscle cells. But instead the vax was designed with PEG polymers on the outside, so that the immune system will not be able to pick them up and put them in the trash. The PEG is what Byram Bridle says is the reason the vaccine travels throughout the body and since it does not have targeting ligands, it can transfect any type of cell: [https://www.cas.org/resource/blog/understanding-nanotechnology-covid-19-vaccines](https://www.cas.org/resource/blog/understanding-nanotechnology-covid-19-vaccines)

&#x200B;

2. Vaccine enhanced immune escape occurs when a poorly designed or weak vaccine helps create new variants. This happens in the exact same way as antibiotic resistance and regular old evolution. In the case of evolution, if you want to make an organism stronger, you put it under evolutionarily unfavorable conditions. This way you kill all the weak examples of the organism and just leave the strong ones. If you want to create heat resistant bacteria, put a petri dish full of the bacteria under moderately high heat that kills 99% of the bacteria. Save the 1% that were able to survive the heat, allow them to grow, and repeat the process over and over again while turning up the heat just a little each time. Do this until you have a population of bacteria that are all extremely heat resistant. The same process occurs with antibiotic resistance. When you only take half your meds, you kill 99% of the bacteria and you leave only the 1% that were slightly more resistant to the drugs and now they flourish. Before they were a small part of the population but you changed the conditions of their environment so that they have the advantage. You've killed all the normal bacteria that the mutant variants had to compete with so that now the antibiotic resistant bacteria are the alpha strain that have unlimited resources and so surge in population to take over your body. Well, the same thing happens with viruses and vaccines. If you produce a vaccine that elicits a weak immune response, you are creating an unfavorable environment for the virus. This will kill the weak 99%, and leave those 1% of mutant virus particles that are not as hindered by the antibodies produced by the vaccine. Whereas before these mutants were only a tiny part of the population and would have been unlikely to transmit on to the next person. Now these mutant virus particles surge in number because they no longer have to compete with the other virus particles and your bodies defenses do not work. They are now highly likely to transmit on to the next person, whereas before they would not have been able to leave the host in which the mutation occured. In terms of creating variants, the current covid vaccines are very bad for three reasons. First, some vaccine manufacturers require two shots and now also boosters because the first shot produces a very weak immune response. Second, the vaccines are very leaky. Even after you have gotten a full immune response from both shots, you can still get and transmit the virus onto others. Well, which virus particles are likely to get passed on by a fully vaccinated person? Clearly they will be those virus particles that have the ability to multiply quickly while avoiding the antibodies produced by the vaccines. This will create very virulent and antibody resistant variants. Watch for these variants in the news as time goes on, we're already seeing things like Delta, Lambda, Eplsion, etc. As we implement boosters, they will start to come at faster and faster rates, and over time data scientists will start to see timed correlations between the implementation of mass boosters and the emergence of new strains. Third, the vaccines do seem to help reduce the severity of the disease when people are infected (although this may change as new variants emerge). Why would this be a concern? Well, because of the leakiness of the vaccines we just spoke about. If you have very low symptoms but you can still get and transmit the virus, then you won't even realize that you're sick and you'll be spreading the virus to even more people as an asymptomatic carrier. So, these vaccines will only increase transmission by creating more and more asymptomatic carriers (although this may not be a bad thing, if everyone in the world gets the virus and everyone is asymptomatic, then there's really no need to care about covid anymore. But this is an unrealistic idealization that is unlikely to occur, some people will still get sick and die or suffer long haul covid). One additional point to address here is the claim that the unvaccinated are causing the emergence of new vaccine resistant variants. Let me be clear, the unvaccinated absolutely have the ability to facilitate the creation of new variants. However, it would require a statistically enormous number of people to get the virus before they could produce a new variant by chance. This is because a mutant virus particle will only make up a small portion of the virus population inside a person's body. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that this particular particle will be able to spread to a new person. Whereas, in the vaccinated, their weak immune response specifically selects for the mutant variants. It is highly likely that if a vaccinated person passes on the virus to another person, the particles they pass on will be those that have the ability to escape from the immune response elicited by the vaccines. An analogy would be if you did an experiment with 500 room temperature petri dishes filled with bacteria and 500 heated petri dishes with bacteria, then found a heat resistant variant but didn't know which dish it came from. It would be absurd to think that the heat resistant strain of bacteria came from the room temperature petri dishes. It would possible, sure, but completely improbable that the heat resistant strain had suddenly appeared in a room temp petri dish. There would be no reason for it to become a dominant strain in that environment. Logically, statistically, and evolutionarily, it must have come from the heated petri dishes. This is a very basic and obvious conclusion, but the media and government bureaucrats in lab coats are trying to tell you that the absurd thing is true. They're trying to say that the unvaccinated (the room temperature petri dishes) are where the vaccine resistant strains are coming from.

3. There is a potential for ADE, antibody dependent enhancement. This is when the virus mutates so that the antibodies no longer neutralize the virus but the antibodies still try to attach to it. This can actually help the virus get into your immune cells because when the virus is covered with antibodies it will draw macrophages to the virus that will try to eat it. However, when your macrophages come to eat the virus particle that they think has been neutralized, the virus gets inside them and starts replicating because the antibodies actually didn't neutralize the virus. Your own antibodies act like a kind of Trojan Horse. Another way that ADE can happen is your own antibodies connect to the receptors of your cells and actually help the virus get in directly. This was a huge problem with the Dengue vaccine and we need to do a lot of testing to make sure this isn't a possibility. Clearly with these rushed vaccines we haven't eliminated this possibility and with the virus mutating, ADE may pop up with a later variant. We must stay vigilant and keep an eye out for this signal. It will manifest as people with high antibody levels being more likely to get sick and die.

&#x200B;

4. There is a potential for an autoimmune response from the vaccines. The vaccines that were developed for Sars-Cov-1 used the spike protein, just like the vaccines for Sars-Cov-2. Unfortunately, those vaccines caused the animals to develop serious autoimmune disorders and they ended up causing severe organ damage. There is a question about whether these new vaccines, which also focus on the spike protein, will also cause autoimmune disorders. The problem is that autoimmune disorders take time to develop and to show up. It may also take a long time before doctors and scientists can link the sudden rise in autoimmune disorders with these vaccines. Usually, in a vaccine trial you closely monitor your trial group for years and years. This allows you to identify the signals. With the current program of injecting millions of people, there will be no clear way to link causation to the vaccines and an increase in autoimmune disorders may just fly under the radar. We may not know for a very long time or never. Another concern is that because of the way the mRNA vaccines work, they cause your own cells to present as foreign entities. Your immune system comes over and starts killing your own cells. This has never been done before in human history. We have no idea if there will be long term consequences for this and whether this will lead to autoimmune disorders.

&#x200B;

Journal article from 2020 explains why immune disorders happen with covid vax, because human and Covid19 proteins are similar: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589909020300186](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589909020300186)

&#x200B;

5. The mRNA vaccines are narrowly focused on just the spike protein when they could have been designed to target more proteins. The Covid19 coronavirus has 4 main proteins. There are 3 on its outside and 1 on the inside. The S-protein, the M-protein, and the E-protein, are on the outside, while the N-protein is on the inside. When you get a natural infection your body will likely produce antibodies for all or most of these proteins (depending on the function of your own unique immune system). We knew from studying Sars-Cov-1 that antibodies to the S-protein and the M-protein are both neutralizing. In fact, they used exactly that knowledge when they designed the current vaccines. So, they could have tried to make vaccines that utilize the M-protein to avoid the potential for autoimmune disorders discussed above. But they didn't, they instead focused only on the S-protein. They could have designed the vaccines so that they present both the S-protein and the M-protein. This would have made the vaccines much more effective and less leaky since any mutated virus particles would have to have mutated both the S-protein and the M-protein to avoid the antibodies. Whereas, the current vaccines are narrowly focused on just the S-protein, meaning that the virus only has to mutate the one protein. It is exponentially harder for an organism to mutate two beneficial traits vs just mutating one beneficial trait. So, these vaccines are worse than they could have been.

&#x200B;

Vaccine efficacy:-

&#x200B;

Article explains how vaccine manufacturers have used relative risk reduction to determine that vaccine efficacy is \~90+%, however they should have used absolute risk reduction which would tell us that the vaccines will only reduce total covid cases by \~1%: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fulltext)

&#x200B;

Article from 2005 explains that antibodies to the S-protein and the M-protein are effective in neutralizing the sars-cov1 virus. However, the sars-cov2 vaccines only target the S-protein. This is evidence that the vaccine manufacturers could have chosen to make a superior mrna vax that produced two types of antibodies, but chose to focus narrowly on just the S-protein: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16544518/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16544518/)

&#x200B;

6. There are alternative treatments that are effective against Covid19 but they are being suppressed. Why? Because the vaccines are not approved by the FDA but instead they are emergency use authorized only. The emergency use authorization can only be granted if ""there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives"". Well, a growing body of scientific research is showing that both Ivermectin and Fluvoxamine (among other drugs) are adequate alternatives for early treatment of Covid19, and both of these drugs have been FDA approved for years. Unfortunately, that means they are now off patent and no one can make any money off of them. So, for the vaccines to continue to receive their EUA, the existence of these treatments must be suppressed. We have seen a huge amount of censorship of doctors who have been speaking out about these drugs.

&#x200B;

Ivermectin:-

&#x200B;

Emergency use authorization for the vaccines cannot be granted if there are effective alternative approved treatments for Covid19.

7. We've known for decades that once you are infected with a virus or disease, your body creates a robust immune response, including memory T cells and B cells. These cells stick around so that you can quickly respond to a new infection. However, this fact is being completely ignored by vaccine pushers, they want a needle in every arm, even in the arms of those who do not need it, like the covid recovered. We might say, well covid is new and different, and perhaps immunity wanes after a time. This assumption was prudent in the beginning of the pandemic but now we have lots of evidence that the covid recovered have a near zero chance of getting sick again. Your body takes a few weeks and months to build up its antibodies after an infection. Most of the time the second infection takes place during this time frame. There is no reason to force every covid recovered patient to take an experimental drug, especially after that initial 3 month period after they have build up a sufficient immune response. If you still think that the miniscule chance that their immune system has failed makes them a danger, then why are these people not asked for proof of antibodies. It's because they don't actually care if you have antibodies. The vaccinated, without knowing whether they have antibodies or not, can walk around free, but a covid recovered patient, with proof of antibodies is still considered a danger. It's ass backwards and it is evidence that vax pushers don't actually care about immunity. It is just about getting a needle into every arm. The reason why they are doing this, I do not know I leave it up to you, but it doesn't make sense and I make a point of not going along with things that don't make sense.

&#x200B;

8. There is a growing amount of data that people are having severe reactions to the vaccines. It gets little to no coverage in the press, in some cases people who talk about their reactions on social media are being censored and called anti-vaxxers (I mean, how asinine to call someone who took the jab an anti-vaxxer) or fakers (I am sure some are faking for money/attention, but I highly doubt it's many of them given the social consequences for lying). Some senators have done press conferences with these people so they can tell their stories. There are publicly accessible government databases which contain reports of people who have had adverse reactions to the vaccines. These systems were put in place in the 90's to act as a sort of early warning system and to give transparency to the public after previous botched vaccine rollouts like the 1976 swine flu vaccine debacle. You can go and read these reports for yourself. There are websites that download the reports and present them to the public in a very readable manner (the government website from the 90's is not very good). There are concerns that these reports are being made in error or by bad actors. However, research has been done into these systems and it was found that more than 80% of the adverse reactions had seemingly no other cause or explaination aside from the vaccine. In the past, if a vaccine hit 50 deaths or a few hundred adverse reactions on these reporting systems, they would shutdown the vaccination program. As of writing this, for the covid vaccines the deaths are into the thousands and the serious adverse reactions are into the hundreds of thousands. Yet they just keep rolling with the shots and now are even forcibly manadating the shot.

&#x200B;

VAERS:-

&#x200B;

Analysis on the VAERS death data shows that in 86% of reports the vaccine cannot be ruled out as a causal factor in the death of the patient: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352837543\_Analysis\_of\_COVID-19\_vaccine\_death\_reports\_from\_the\_Vaccine\_Adverse\_Events\_Reporting\_System\_VAERS\_Database\_Interim\_Results\_and\_Analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352837543_Analysis_of_COVID-19_vaccine_death_reports_from_the_Vaccine_Adverse_Events_Reporting_System_VAERS_Database_Interim_Results_and_Analysis)

&#x200B;

Addendum to the above link. OpenVAERS is a site that allows you to easily read VAERS reports and breaks down the numbers. The reports seem to be a lot of people who have comorbidities or are old, but there are also some really eye opening cases where young people experience horrible side effects.

&#x200B;

9. Criminals are innocent until proven guilty, but medical drugs are not like criminals, medical drugs are guilty until proven innocent. Pharmaceutical companies must prove the innocence of their medications through long term testing. Doctors, bureaucrats, and the public seem to have forgotten this fact when they mandate a new technology to be injected into us without long term testing to prove the innocence of the drug. The vaccine may have completely unknown and serious side effects that manifest in a majority of the people only in the long term. So, the vax may appear to be safe in the short term, but in the long run it causes severe harm or even death. It is extremely risky to innoculate the entire population if we don't know what the long term effects may be. It is especially risky to vax our critical workers with an experimental drug about which we know nothing in the long term. If it turns out that within 2 years of taking it, the vaccine causes the debilitation of a large portion of the people who took it and we had forced all our healthcare professionals to take it, then our countries will lose a large portion of their healthcare professionals. This would devastate our society's ability to treat the sick and cause massive death and suffering. Same goes for the military. If we vax all our fighters, and the vax turns out to greatly physically or mentally weaken most of the people who took it, there goes our ability to defend ourselves. We won't be able to fight off any aggressors and will lose years of military experience as we will have to re-train a whole new set of recruits without the previous military leaders. If most of the laborers are vaxxed and the vax causes bodily weakness, then they won't be able to go to work and our production falls to zero. Without domestic production, we would have to rely on foreign imports but the economy would also grind to a halt so the nation would have no money to pay for these imports. This would probably be a death stroke for whatever nation was victim to it. So, force vaccinating critical workers, or even a large portion of the menial labor force, is a massive national security risk. We also have no way of calculating how large the percentage of risk is since we know nothing at all about the long term effects of innoculation with this type of technology. This could utterly destroy any highly vaxxed nations. This outcome would be so bad (total collapse of a society's infrastructure) that only a massive amount of safety data could justify innoculating the entire population with any treatment. But we just don't have that safety data for these experimental drugs right now, and will probably not have it for decades to come. By then, it will be too late to do anything about it. You can fry an egg, but you can't unfry it. Just the same, you won't be able to unvax the population, there's no way to get the vax out of the body once it's in. The solution is to only vax the old and vulnerable at risk populations and not vax everyone. This issue worries me deeply since there must be risk responsive people at high levels of government who must understand and be sensitive to this type of national security risk. Yet, these people are either being completely ignored or they are allowing the government to proceed with the risky mass vaccination programs anyway.

&#x200B;

Separately, these 9 issues would be a concern. But put together, they are incredibly alarming. To me, something feels very wrong here. You too may have already felt it in your gut or in the back of your mind or when reading this. That feeling that something is wrong is instinct, it is the product of millions of years of evolution. A gift from our ancestors who also saw something that was wrong in their environment and had this weird bad feeling. They acted on it and it saved them. So they were able to pass on that instinct to their off-spring from generation to generation. Now, after millions of years, it finds its way to you. If you feel what I feel, that something is very wrong here, I implore you: Do not ignore it.

Other than a very few anecdotal stories, It appeared as if this was being censored quickly... so I took to reddit. 

&#x200B;

I found the r/ivermectin subreddit, at first there were tons of anecdotal stories of people curing their lingering covid symptoms, or preventing covid also, I even made a post about how it cleared up A LOT of my long covid symptoms, and I got castrated (figuratively) for it. Then, as time passed Random recently created reddit users started appearing  and posting horse porn message and pictures, making horse semen puns, etc. I was like.. what the hell is going

&#x200B;

***CONSPIRACY BEGINS HERE--->:***  I was browsing the sub  a couple days ago because sometimes I go through subreddits just to hop in and out during work, and it seemed to be dead at this point due to the massive influx of horse porn pictures, I was reading through the comments on one of the pictures because I was trying to still find anyone else who didn't appear to be a  bot or paid shill and I will paraphrase but this is what someone said essentially.

Someone responded and asked: ""Legit?"" and the random reddit account responded with ""Yup.""

>JOPES is a combination of joint policies and procedures (guidance), and automated data processing (ADP) support used to plan and execute joint military operations.    

>Although JOPES (and its related systems) has been used for over 20 years to support the development of operation plans and time phased force and deployment data (TPFDD), **the current automated system was given its first real baptism of fire in Operation Desert Shield to assist in managing a real world operational deployment**.

>Since then, JOPES ADP has been used in virtually every deployment. Even though its performance is far from ideal, it has become an integral part of our ability to deploy forces.

>This primer provides a general overview of JOPES. Its purpose is to correct the common misconception that JOPES is only an ADP system by explaining in clear and succinct terms what JOPES truly is. 

>This document is intended to be used as a companion piece to the User's Guide to Joint Operation Planning, dated **11 September 1994**. That document provides a more detailed overview of joint planning principles.

What. The. **DUCK** Isn't it odd how many points of significance fall on September 11th? But think about the above in terms of how much further they are ahead of us. They had this system being developed a decade and a half before the second invasion. Thankfully it wasn't all being planned out in advance.

**Oh.**

>In 1998, Kristol and Kagan advocated regime change in Iraq throughout the Iraq disarmament process through articles that were published in the New York Times. Following perceived Iraqi unwillingness to co-operate with UN weapons inspections, core members of the PNAC including Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, R. James Woolsey, Elliot Abrams, Donald Rumsfeld, Robert Zoellick, and John Bolton were among the signatories of an open letter initiated by the PNAC to President Bill Clinton calling for the removal of Saddam Hussein.

**Oh. Crap**.   

Ok. Lets calm down, shall we? Sure, they wanted Saddam Hussein out of power, wouldn't you? After all, he **might have had those weapons of mass distraction** because Colin Powell said so. And he based his opinion on the word of Judith Miller who worked for the New York Times. And Judith Miller ended up using a source for her story which wasn't truthful. So the entire invasion of a foreign country was based on a reporters word who used made up information. Perfect. Let's check in and see what she's up to these days, shall we?    

>**As of 2018, she is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She has also been a member of the Aspen Strategy Group,** and has served on a prestigious National Academy of Sciences panel examining how best to expand of the work of the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, which since 1991 has sought to stop the spread of WMD material and expertise from the former Soviet Union. She lectures frequently on the Middle East, Islam, terrorism, biological and chemical weapons, as well as other national security topics. 
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Miller)   


Bwahahahaha. I'm sorry. I really am. **If I started writing this kind of crap in a book of fiction**, nobody would belive it. She now works for the Council of Foreign Relations (Rockefeller Foundation) and the Aspen Group. Thank God these people don't get rewarded for manipulating society, right? Because that's not a reward. Not. At. All. She's just using her expertise to stop weapons of mass distraction being used by terrorists, just like she did as a journalist to start a war and occupation in Iraq. Good times. And while we all believed oil and money was the prime motivation for the war back then (and some still do), the truth is a little bit more complicated. 

#Worldwide Military Command and Control System

>The Worldwide Military Command and Control System, or WWMCCS /ˈwɪmɛks/, was a military command and control system implemented for the command and control of the United States military. It was created in the days following the Cuban Missile Crisis. WWMCCS was a complex of systems that encompassed the elements of warning, communications, data collection and processing, executive decision-making tools and supporting facilities.      

>**During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, WWMCCS performed flawlessly 24 hours a day, seven days a week; providing critical data to combat commanders worldwide in deploying, relocating and sustaining allied forces.**

>On August 30, 1996, Lieutenant General Albert J. Edmonds, Director, Defense Information Systems Agency, officially deactivated the Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS) Intercomputer Network (WIN). Concurrently, the Joint Staff declared the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) as the joint command and control system of record.   
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Military_Command_and_Control_System)   

Do you see what I mean? Is it obvious? They needed a real life training ground for the system. Because simulations only work so well. Real life is a whole other ball game. It's messy. They need a real life test. And when they do, they upgrade the system. 

>GCCS is the embodiment of the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence(C4I) for the Warrior concept. C4I for the Warrior, through GCCS, will provide the necessary information for warfighters to fight and win on the battlefield today and in the future.
>The first operational version of GCCS is scheduled to come on line in September 1995. JOPES ADP is just one of many C2 systems that will migrate to GCCS. Initially, GCCS will provide the same planning and execution capability as the JOPES ADP currently residing on WWMCCS. Future modifications, however, will modernize JOPES ADP and combine its capabilities with other C2 systems to form a more powerful, integrated tool for warplanning. Upgrades to JOPES capabilities will provide the warfighter the tools to support execution as well
as planning.

#Jade Helm 2015: Artificial Intelligence in the Military Drivers Seat

JULY 18, 2015  / ANDREW PONTBRIAND
[Source Here](https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Jade-Helm-2015--Artificial-Intelligence-in-the-Military-Drivers-Seat.html?soid=1114009586911&aid=30YM4VTcQbQ)    


Well look at that, would you. Jade Helm wasn't as simple as it seems, was it? All the talk about Walmart detention centers and martial law is starting to look like a psychological operation designed to take away attention from an AI system being trained to run the armed forces. Now where have I seen that plot line play out before?    

Ok. Let's look into the **JADE** backronym a little bit deeper. Because something smells more rotten than Klaus Schwab taking a dump on the toilet. 


#JADE (planning system)

>**In 1999, the operational tool used for managing force deployment planning in the U.S. military was the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES)**. The JADE tool for rapid crisis action planning had been developed by BBN Technologies under a contract to DARPA within the **ARPA-Rome Planning Initiative**, but was available only in a prototype environment. In subsequent years, JADE was successfully demonstrated and then integrated into the **Global Command and Control System** (GCCS) and the Adaptive Course of Action (ACOA) environment while meeting the requirements of the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII-COE).    
>An official 2016 document approved for public release titled **Human Systems Roadmap Review** describes plans to create autonomous weapon systems that analyze social media and make decisions, including the use of lethal force, with minimal human involvement. This type of system is referred to as a Lethal Autonomous Weapon System (LAWS).
**The name ""JADE"" comes from the jade green color seen on the island of Oahu in Hawaii where the U.S. Pacific Command** (PACOM) is headquartered.
JFRG II will be replaced with JADE.
 [Source Here]https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JADE_(planning_system)       


I haven't said it in a while, but always remember, **WORDS MATTER**. They don't pull them out of a hat. And they pick the message before they pick the acronym, creating a backronym. So if something is in bold up above, it's for a reason. We might not touch on that reason until a later post, but we'll get there.    

Does this concern you? Because it should. It really should. We're moving full tilt into a future were machine intelligence will have control. And the military systems are only the first step to getting them **NEW NORMALized** for society. They're already working on predictive policing. They're already working on making the surveillance system bigger and better. They're already trying to make facial recognition software a part of society. And once this system is complete, and the human factor is slowly minimized, how will we make sure the system still works for all of society, rather than those in control of the system? Because once you take the humans out of the loop and replace them with an AI system, they no longer have to fear a revolt from their security forces.  

Am I being a fear monger? Taking events too far? Maybe. But I would rather prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Because this is unprecedented, and if you don't think they care what you think now, wait until it doesn't matter what you think. Wait until they don't need you. Because they'll only let the truth come out when it's too late for us to do anything about it. When they don't fear us is when their true colors will shine.    

Still doubt it? Still don't think a Skynet could ever happen because you saw a movie with a guy who said:   


#Arnold Schwarzenegger takes on anti-maskers: ‘Screw your freedom’
[Source Here](https://globalnews.ca/news/8106446/arnold-schwarzenegger-covid-19-masks-freedom/)    


Sure, it's easy to believe all of this is an overactive imagination. Sure, it's comforting to think we have a tech **UTOPIA** up ahead, and everything will be all sunshine and unicorn farts that smell like roses. But what if it's not. What if we have some evidence that **somethings happening here, and what it is, ain't exactly clear?**   


#Skynet (satellite)

>Skynet is a family of military communications satellites, now operated by Airbus Defence and Space on behalf of the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence (MoD). They provide strategic and tactical communication services to the branches of the British Armed Forces, the British intelligence agencies, some UK government departments and agencies, and to allied governments. **Since 2015 when Skynet coverage was extended eastward and in conjunction with an Anik G1 satellite module over America, Skynet offers global coverage.**
Source Here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(satellite)   

Since 2015. The same year they practiced **JADE Helm**. Nope. Nothing to see here folks. Nothing at all. And to make it even worse, let me show you one last item:   

#What is China’s SKYNET (yes: it is what you think it is)

**Skynet is the Chinese government’s video surveillance system, which it claims is for tracking criminals. Under the project, more than 20 million cameras have been set up in public spaces across the country.**

>It’s said to be able to catch a fugitive within minutes.
**The “Skynet Project”, China’s national surveillance system, has more than 20 million cameras deployed in public spaces across the country**, according to state media. Dedicated to “live surveillance and recording”, there are plans to add hundreds of millions more by 2020.    
[Source Here](https://www.bgp4.com/2019/05/10/what-is-chinas-skynet-yes-it-is-what-you-think-it-is/)    

Is this just a coincidence? Or are they two competing systems of AI? Is this why the USA suddenly freaked about the 5G network and Huawei? Is this why Canada detained:   

#Meng Wanzhou: Trudeau rejects calls to release top Huawei executive
[Source Here](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53183654)   

More importantly, as I've previously written about, this is more than likely why they used a backronym and named it **JADE**. Because of the significance to China. A message hidden in plain sight. Just like China calling their system **SKYNET** is a message to us. Unless of course, they're both calling it **SKYNET** because they're both working together and it's all a show.     

Let's. Hope. Not.    

#Final Thought   

**Do you want SKYNET? Because this is how you get SKYNET

There could be a few reasons for this including:

- different reporting standards by military hospitals regarding Covid being primary vs contributory cause of death. 
- general level of fitness, nutrition, and physical activity, though this doesn’t apply to dependents’ low numbers. 

Why are the numbers this low?

Why isn’t anyone talking about this?

**THE UNVACCINATED**. 

Everyone asking ""who would you keep alive"", its pretty clear they would keep those that function under all this pressure/control, the unvaccinated.


The vaccinated are literally aggressive, and misinformative due to their lack of general education, and the information that they are being fed by the news. 

Go tell a vaccinated person who considered you a ""conspiracy theorist"" and tell them this:


>Ivermectin won the 2015 nobel prize in medicine, and over 3.7 billion doses have been administered worldwide, and if ivermectin were to be taken off the shelves, would literally kill thousands of people in poor developing countries. 


Watch their reaction, oh and a quick google gives me:

 >Ivermectin, an old and well used drug, works on a myriad of parasitic diseases including worms. 3.7 billion people have been given Ivermectin. It has little if any side effects, and is inexpensive.

>About 3.7 billion doses of ivermectin have been distributed in mass drug administration campaigns globally over the past 30 years. Presently, ivermectin is approved for use in humans in several countries to treat onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, strongyloidiasis, and scabies.

Who would be easier to deal with:

1: Those who have gone months living under scrutiny, control, etc and still manage to stay mentally and physically fit, maintain work, etc. 

2: Those who don't know what they would do if they can't go to the movie theater or the bar with their friends, doesn't read any of the peer reviewed studies, doesn't build an understanding of whats being presented/misrepresented, etc, literally a foolish mob. 




**EVIL SUPER VILLAIN SCENARIO**: I will be blunt here: If I was a ""super villain"" I would 100% make the ones I want to survive be smart, refuse to take something they have researched, and are able to function with levels of controls and lockdowns placed on them for TONS of various things.  

I would then lock them up into quarantine facilities for the health of the general public or call them mentally ill, unable to make their own mentally sound decisions, and a doctor takes over their decisions in the most evil way (this happens everyday, don't act shocked).


I would then cause hellfire/a real pandemic on those outside of my safe, sterile quarantine centers, getting arid of all the fucking useless sheep who can't live without going to the fucking bar or fucking a tinder date, those with minimal education, unable to truly think for themselves and make positive change, etc.

Body:

There is a Temple called Padmanabhaswamy in Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital of Kerala, India. This is the temple of Vishnu. Popular legends insisted that this temple held 8 secret chambers.

In 2011, the Supreme Court of India authorized the temple to be explored. The Apex Court appointed a 7 member team to make a record of the treasures of the temple. The group searched with the temple administrator, they uncovered six mysterious chambers, labeling them chamber A, B, C, D, E and F. Of these 6 chambers, the group was able to open 5 of them, though not without significant effort, including grueling labor, and the employment of modern machinery. Remarkably, two more further subterranean vaults have been discovered since, and they have been designated as Vault G and Vault H.

Opening the doors of these chambers has proved to be an even more daunting task. However, eventually they did gain access to these vaults as well. In the vault they found gold, diamonds and other precious gems and stones statues, golden crowns worn by Ancient kings, thrones made of precious metals worth more than a TRILLION US dollars. 

However, the total value of the treasure of Padmanabhaswamy temple is still unknown, as they could not open the main chamber door of Chamber B. Coincidentally, of all the vaults,the Bharatakkon Kallara, Chamber B is believed to be the one most deeply rooted to Vishnu, also known as Padmanabhaswamy.

Chamber B has proved to be impossible to open for mysterious reasons that prevent their access. Let’s explore the mystery surrounding the last door that remains in secrecy from the Padmanabhaswamy temple devotees and the government of India.

The Gate Is Believed To Be Sealed By A Naga Bandhana

This gate is the entrance to the last secret chamber that has been discovered inside the Padmanabhaswamy temple. The gate is guarded by two saints, and it is said that inside this chamber, is a very large room that hides invaluable treasures, incredible mysteries, technologies, and great knowledge of the ancients. The saints say the door is sealed by sound waves that are produced from a location whose coordinates have been lost in time.

According to the experts in the esoteric field, opening the last door of the Padmanabhaswamy temple could be very risky and dangerous. This door has no mechanism, crank, nut or button that hints at how to open it. In addition, there are carved two serpent figures on each side, which is seen as a warning and bad omen meant for those who dare to violate it. Mysterious, sensual, and dangerous, the female vampire Kanjirottu Yakshi is one of several supernatural entities said to guard the chamber. 

It is believed that this gate is sealed by a Naga Bandhana or Naga Paasam ― the process of tying up something valuable with a frieze of nagas, serpents of the cobra variety. It is essentially a tantrika (occult) form of worship or tantrika process, supposedly of the Atharva Veda origin.

The procedure is not to be found in any written form. It is highly secretive and known only to a few Siddha Yogis (great saints) who live or once lived in Siddhashram, a secret and mystical land deep in the Himalayas.

According to many, the Naga Bandhana are mechanisms of locks that work with the sound waves of a particular person’s voice, a worthy saint, essentially a voice activated “spell”. This “spell” produces small vibrations that trigger the mechanisms in the door to enter. It is said that if another person tries to open the door with a different “spell” or a different voice, then the sound waves will change direction, stirring up some great evil that could include being attacked by venomous snakes. Some believe that the chamber is connected to the Arabian sea, and will flood India when opened.

These are only a few of the possible misfortunes that might befall someone who was foolish enough to attempt to open the door improperly.

One legends has it that in the 1930s, a group of thieves broke into the temple and attempted to gain access to the treasures of Chamber B, only to be attacked by venomous snakes. 

It is said that the only living person that knows exactly what secrets are held in Chamber B is Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma, the head of the Erstwhile Royal Family of Travancore. Unfortunately, Uthradom Varma died in December of 2013, and with it, his supposed knowledge of the mysterious chamber. 

A Divine Child Will Be Born

As the sages of India say, this gate can only be opened by a learned scholar in the chants of the Garuda mantra. This mantra is said to be able to deactivate the protective Naga Bandhana mechanism. The temple’s saints say that at present there is no human capable of opening this door by executing these mantra chants.

The saints also say that a child with such divine knowledge will be born in India who will be able to execute these sacred chants of the Mantra, and thus the secret vault will be uncovered, unveiling all the secrets and mysterious treasures and technologies that it withheld for ages.

Can The Door Be Opened With Modern Technology?

It is likely with modern technology that the last door can be opened, but the saints warn that if it’s done in that manner, the Indian people, and even the entire world population would suffer terrible cataclysms. Therefore, assuming it as a strict warning, no one has attempted to open the sealed door by using any modern mechanical technology.

However, in May 2016 a Temple Inventory Expert Group petitioned the Supreme Court for permission to open this mysterious and final vault, but the royal family of Travancore, along with some devotees and temple administration have opposed it, now this will be decided in a court decision. According to some unofficial accounts, the decision could be in favour of the experts, with which it would proceed to open the door with modern techniques. 

Will they succeed and uncover unparalleled knowledge and treasure, or doom the Earth to irreversible cataclysm, or simply be unable to open the chamber? Time will tell...

** Updated ** Military Exemption (Religious) Marine Corps and Navy,3,pg3dvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pg3dvb/updated_military_exemption_religious_marine_corps/,7,1630531255.0,"Update to my last post. New guidance and references to the MCO 1730.9 Accommodation of Religious Practices. New guidance from SECNAV (ALNAV 062/21) basically states that service members have 90 days (starting 31 August 2021) to comply and submit their medical/religious exemption. If a service member refuses, they will be punished under Article 92, UCMJ. They will most likely be dishonorable discharged depending on the mood of the command.... We're basically equivalent to rapists if they do dishonorable discharge us which is strange...

Not saying that they will dishonorable discharge everybody refusing! There are a lot of service members refusing. I'm just coming from a POV that my command thinks I'm retarded for not rolling up my sleeves and a lot of people already caved with barely any resistance...

I don't think MCO 1730.9 (Marines) is the right MCO. I only know that my command referenced it. It's more of a... oh, you don't want to eat sheep from the chowhall? Submit this and we'll take it off the menu type of religious accommodation. I still stand with my previous post but, I'll be happy to eat my words and edit this post!

\*\* BREAK \*\*

My previous post got some traction and some service members asked me for help. I'm in the same boat facing the same threats from my command so it's relatable. I did my own research and it's mostly guys who never served trying to help service members. The gesture is nice and helpful at times, but they don't really understand how commands really are. Keep in mind that it's dependent on three main factors:

**\*\*Rank (Including likability in your command and TIS)\*\***

A E3 will get pushed around as they don't know what to expect. A E6 has been around the block to build connections and has a general understanding on how things really work. Regardless of your billet or quals... The command deck will decide things dependent on your rank. Easy to replace an E3. Hard to replace a SNCO and above who knows what they're doing.

**\*\*Field (Aviation, Ground, Admin)\*\***

Ground units are quick to kick a Marine while he's down while Aviation fields are willing to help as it's hard to retain a Marine especially if he's qualified. Aircraft constantly breaks. Someone has to turn wrenches. Ultimately dependent on the demand of the job and difficulty.

**\*\*Command (How do they feel about rolling up sleeves?)\*\***

CO and SgtMaj ultimately makes the shot. The Inspector General is an option but, it's really dependent on what your command deck is scheming. Calling an Inspector General will probably do more harm than good.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I'll break this into parts to help make this as understandable as possible.

There were different species of humans before homo sapiens started existing so maybe that is it because they looked like us but weren't distinctly like us we had to fear them because they'd attack you on sight. That'd make sense because homo sapiens didn't start existing until 300.000 years ago whereas the first ""humans"" / humanoids (think Homo Erectus which is Latin for ""Upright Man"") were alive around 2.5 million years ago so that'd make sense that we evolved to be afraid of the thing that looked humanoid but wasn't distinctly like us.

Hold firm.

Edit: I love you all! I've gotten a ton of questions, so below is what I was lead to use as my strongly held religious belief. I added a more personal section about Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and being protected against discrimination, and the second I feel discriminated for my views, I will take this to the highest level possible and not back down. Also, thank you for the reddit gift things (I'm not sure how they work, but neat!) Most importantly, if you haven't found rest in this world, it's because it comes through Christ. Dust off that bible, or if you need one, DM me and I'll get one coming your way. Times are getting weird, don't gamble with eternity, believe, repent and trust. 


This is what I filled out for the section: What strongly held religious belief precludes you from getting the vaccine?

I too, believe the Bible is the inerrant word of God, and breathed out by God for reproof, correction, and training in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16). In actuality, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God (John 1:1).

Moreover, I believe I was created in the perfect image of my creator (Genesis 1:27, Matthew 5:48, Ephesians 2:10) and there shall not be additions or modifications to Gods perfect plan, that I am equipped through Christ Jesus with everything I need for doing his will (Hebrews 13:21).

I am instructed by God to not conform to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of my mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect (Romans 12:2). Additionally, If I willfully do something I believe is not right, I am sinning, and will face eternal consequences and death (James 4:17, Romans 14:23, Romans 6:23).

Lastly, I find a deep peace in trusting in the LORD for all things, a peace not achieved by worldly pursuits (Psalm 9:10). The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is safe (Proverbs 29:25). I am to trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths (Proverbs 3:5-6).

Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD. He is like a tree planted by water, that sends out its roots by the stream, and does not fear when heat comes, for its leaves remain green, and is not anxious in the year of drought, for it does not cease to bear fruit (Jeremiah 17:7-8).

Blessings come when I lean into faith over fear (Matthew 6:34), and repent (Matthew 4:17), believe and trust in the LORD (Psalm 40:4).",2021-09-01 20:46:06

Fascists Are Using COVID-19 to Advance Their Agenda. It’s Up to Us to Stop Them. Spread the Word.,0,pg22cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pg22cx/fascists_are_using_covid19_to_advance_their/,6,1630527260.0,"The COVID-19 crisis is a story of a predictable pandemic. It is a result of the willful ignorance of the [impact of the climate crisis](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/how-climate-change-increases-our-risk-for-pandemics) and unsustainable expansion, a failure of multiple governments and the intentional under-resourcing of public health and medical systems. It results from our societies’ ignoring of the conditions for poor people, the unhoused, disabled and chronically ill people, sex workers, migrants, communities of color and street-based communities, and the exploitation of this crisis by a rich, privileged and powerful fascist minority. Our government had the information, the resources, and the ability to prepare for this pandemic, including supporting those most at risk. We could have had the tests, the masks, the ventilators, the resources and emergency plans.

These are not mistakes. These are choices. We have been left for dead, and it’s not the first time.

Over the past few years we’ve watched the rise of a global fascist movement in the U.S., Russia, India, Brazil, the United Kingdom and many other countries. And, while scholars and writers currently debate whether to call Trump an authoritarian, autocrat or a fascist, it’s clear that he’s not a fan of democratic institutions, and he often uses a fascist playbook. Fascist and authoritarian governments often exploit, accelerate, or create crises to increase their power and further their agendas.

Here’s the fascist emergency playbook:

* Use the emergency to restrict civil liberties — particularly rights regarding movement, protest, freedom of the press, a right to a trial and freedom to gather;
* Use the emergency to suspend governmental institutions, consolidate power, reduce institutional checks and balances, and reduce access to elections and other forms of participatory governance;
* Promote a sense of fear and individual helplessness, particularly in relationship to the state, to reduce outcry and to create a culture where people consent to the power of the fascist state;
* Replace democratic institutions with autocratic institutions using the emergency as justification;
* Create scapegoats for the emergency, such as immigrants, people of color, disabled people, ethnic and religious minorities, to distract public attention away from the failures of the state and the loss of civil liberties.

These steps are currently in progress. In the past few weeks, multiple cities have started to [arrest people](https://mynorthwest.com/1795679/bellevue-police-stay-at-home-app/) for “violating” stay-at-home and physical distancing decrees. Under Trump’s current emergency powers, the federal government has the [right to detain people](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-extreme-powers-coronavirus-129176) if it’s determined that their “illness” could cross state lines. Federal and state governments are currently laying the foundation for further repressive actions. In Florida, their government is considering [detaining and isolating](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241401496.html) sick people without their consent — for “public health.” In Louisville, Kentucky, COVID-19 patients are being [placed on house arrest](https://www.whas11.com/article/news/local/lou-judges-now-putting-defiant-covid-19-patients-on-house-arrest/417-e8c1ae19-84b6-423a-b210-90ce08b368e7). The Department of Justice is seeking to use emergency powers to [detain people indefinitely](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023) without trial. In some cities people are being charged and detained for [“terroristic threats”](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/491798-texas-teen-who-threatened-to-spread-coronavirus-faces-terrorism) after concerns they had attempted to intentionally spread COVID-19. And Trump persists in calling COVID-19 the “Chinese virus,” foisting responsibility for the global crisis onto a particular group.

Tired of the corruption,9,pg0duu,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pg0duu/tired_of_the_corruption/,3,1630522282.0," 

So, up until last Tuesday I worked for a very well known health insurance company. Last year, March 2020, when COVID hit, the company sent all of their workers to work from home. Things were actually going great and I feel I was able to stay productive and I was overall happy and felt very lucky that I had a job that didnt have to lay workers off due to the pandemic. Sometime in July, I believe, it may have been June, we were told by corporate that they were thinking about having employees return to the office. It stirred things up because everyone was capable of working from home but also because the Delta variant had just started to make its entrance into the news and that made no sense. The company spent so much time telling us in emails how much they cared about our safety and well being and how they have taken every precaution to have us return to the office safely. One of new rules for returning to the office was that if you are vaccinated (mind you, this company is paying $500 to any employee who gets the vaccine) you can bypassthe screening process and will not have to wear a mask nor follow these pathways in the office thatwere designated for people who had not been vaccinated. So if you've been unvaxxed, in order to get in the building you have to be screened by security and get a temperature check and answer if you had been vaxx'd or not. Now, I'm not one who buys into this COVID crap, I'm not exactly sure what's going on but I know something is off with the narrative and it's being pushed along with these vaccines. So, after I got notice of my return to office date I sent some questions to our HR just to see what kind of responses I got back. One thing I asked was, who would be responsible if an employee caught COVID and was seriously ill or ended up dead, would it be corporate or our local office supervisors. HR told me it was up to our ""divisional leadership"" like that isnt vague. So I emailed our CEO and all of the higher ups in one fell swoop asking who would be responsible. They never responded. So, I figured, well I'm small fish in the company so what better way to get their attention than by posting a screenshot I took of the email I sent to the CEO's and put it on a company wide platform that all employees nation wide have access to. Many people reached out, thanked me for asking questions, more questions popped up over conversations with other employees who also said they've tried asking similar questions and got either no answer back or it was some scripted run around answer from corporate. I ended up getting a private meeting with some higher ups because I kept tagging the CEO's in the conversations on the platform along with my screenshots of the emails I had sent. The meeting I got consisted of one higher up lady, an HR person and a local higher up guy in my office all of which gave me run around answers so toward the end of that meeting, the top lady and HR lady were getting frustrated with me and called the meeting to an end because I didnt accept their scripted jargon. So the higher up from my local office said hed meet with me the next day (all meetings were online, not in person) to discuss questions I still had that had not been answered. One of the things I was told was that the orders to return to the office came from a committee within the company and that committee decided on the employees behalf that we should all return. Now, at this point my questions had evolved because the way management was acting started to set off red flags for me and for other people too. I asked the higher up lady who was on this committee that decided for everyone to return to the office and she told me that she wasnt going to tell me. They started censoring me, they took one of my posts down from the platform because they said it violated the terms of agreement and I asked where that was in the policy and they sent back a highlighted section that said management could take down any post they felt was inappropriate. They also told me not to share what was discussed in that meeting with others on the platform and I was told condescendingly by the HR woman that she knows I think I speak for everyone and that my future at the company was going to be up to me and if I was willing to comply with this return to office policy. Really sketchy. Anyway, in my meeting the next day with one of my local higher ups, I asked him who was on that committee and he said he didnt even know so I asked him if he could ask corporate and he said no. He said, why would you even want to know that? And what good would it do knowing that anyway. Toward the end of this meeting this man was exhausted and I asked him to pass along 3 questions to corporate, the first question was why employees who were unvaccinated were being discriminated against in the building if vaxx'd people were just as contagious. If the company was getting an incentive for employees who got the vaccine and the last question was who was on that committee that decided the return to office. I was told that he would pass it along. The next week, my first day back in the office for over a year and I refused to answer if I had been vaxx'd at security, I wore a face shield instead of a mask because I can't breathe in a mask and a faceshield is just as effective as the face diaper and was told I had to have a mask on underneath which I refused. Security told me he couldnt stop me fromentering the building but had to write me up so I went in to do my work, along the way, he asked me if I was the one online who was starting up stuff haha, I got to my desk and workedfor about 2.5hrs and decided to check that platform because a lady had reached out to me and was telling me the censorship wasgetting really bad again so I tagged the CEO's yet again with a screenshot of me asking why my posts were being deleted for asking questions. Well minutes afterthat last post I was approached by my superiors supervisor and told to go to the local higher ups office and to leave my stuff at my desk. So I got my phone and went to his office, he told me that he was going to walk me out of the building because my face shield was unacceptable and asked if I had anything at my desk I needed. So I was brought my purse and my thermos and was escorted out of the building and before Ileft I asked if I am able to come back tomorrow and he said my supervisor would call me. I got home and on the phone my supervisor was on the line with a different HR lady and I was told that I was terminated for wearing a face shield and enendagering the health of other employees. So yeah, I'm tired of these corrupt assholes.",2021-09-01 18:51:22

- The ""taliban hanged someone from a helicopter"" video turned out to be a guy in a harness so they could remove some flags

- The Australian video supposedly depicting a forceful vaccination of a crying child turned out to be a child custody thing and nothing to do with vaccination

- The other Australian video supposedly depicting a forceful vaccination of a child turned out to be a kid who doesn't like needless but wanted to be vaccinated

- The US military left <dollar amount> of hardware in Afghanistan, turns out the obvious is true, it's all ANA gear

- The ""No we don't want him to speak"" video of Pelosi supposedly cutting off Biden was done by a conservative voice actor as ""satire""

- No, Australia did not ""mass vax kids in a stadium"". It was a completely voluntary vaccine drive for 17 and 18 year olds

- No, 2,3 or whatever number of kids you've read about did not die at the previously named event.

- No, France is not forcing people to get vaccinated to be able to buy food. The rules only apply to big box store size supermarkets and do not affect home delivery or curbside pickup where available. You can also show a valid self test.

I'm from Ontario, 19yrs old and about a month ago i was pretty much ready to jump off a bridge. Instead I decided I'd go on a roadtrip lol. I didn't really have a plan, only a few grand saved up but I just left. Said fuck it and ran took my shitty honda accord and just left. I didn't look at my phone at all besides occasionally looking at a map and it was amazing. Driving out into the middle of nowhere, not knowing where I was going to sleep or what I was going to eat, knowing every kilometer was another away from home, it was fantastic. I didn't go back, right now I'm renting a trailer and working in Alberta with some amazing people who are like minded. Granted I'm still not great. On the road was amazing but I need to make money somehow. 

But the point I'm trying to make is that I see a lot of posts and comments here from people who seem like they're ready to give up and they've lost all hope but cmon guys the world may be ending but lighten up go outside go on an adventure, a good start would be to stop looking into what's going on every second like I was.

I have [covered the Crypto, Bitcoin, Fallacy](https://dethinkxify2.wordpress.com/2021/04/15/what-about-the-supercomputer-supercherie-of-craig-steven-right-and-cloudcroft/) in a series of posts on my Wordpress account, which has gain me a new hate club in Canada, especially among the bureaucrat corruptible; cryptos have become the token of choice for political and civil servant, public official bribery.

As I commented to Peter: ""...not so fast..."". While effectively, the FED may have conflicts of interests in its ""appreciation"" of Bitcoin...Peter is not getting the core of what is going on. All Central Bankers appear to be repatriating their own nation's currency. It's been the case for the US Fed for the past year. I wonder if the excess market volatility is just to excite transactions intensity to increase the opportunity for repatriation.

Why would they do this? Because their dream, which appeared to have been put on the ice after discussions about it at Davos between 2013 and 2017, is back. Their dream is to convert traditional US Dollars for some type of Crypto. Canada was the most passionate about the necessity for a crypto Canadian dollar of some kind at the time. I don't view this as very encouraging.

I sure hate cryptos, but when I hear the conjoined voices of the different central bankers in unison criticizing the cryptos, I fear its because the big Reset will give birth to Central Banking Cryptos...not a good news at all.

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/k5m68a/13th_families_and_the_law_of_one/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Now here are some interesting tie ins

1. Third eye spies: https://youtu.be/y1VX_W32mNM

A documentary on how a group of scientists started to examine and developing methods of remote viewing. Speaking on the psychic abilities of the top psychics of the time. Specifically a man who could describe and sketch out perfectly detailed areas of coordinates without ever having to see them and revealing great secrets and even finding kidnapped victims.

Now how does this tie in with the Law of One? Well evidence of psychics and evidence of the connection of souls and reality. Remote viewing only makes sense if all life is connected and that there are ways to branch out of your existence into the existence of other people and objects. 

2. Bernardo Kastrup podcast ""The Cosmic Nervous system"": https://psychedelicsalon.com/podcast-448-the-cosmic-nervous-system/

""my favorite section of this talk comes when he suggests that cosmic consciousness at-large may actually be experiencing what we humans call multiple personality disorder.""

He basically speaks about how connected the metaphysical plain is and how the universe is just a stream of consciousness trying to experience itself. Very similar to the Law of one but he's a bit more ""scientific"" if you will.

3. Terence Mckenna ""The Living Dead"": https://youtu.be/fVEcpdLZ8mE

""What I invision is boundary dissolution, if all boundaries dissolve then I am you and you are me and we are all together. It's an exfoliation of the human experience""

""So the whole challenge is to dream a dream worthy of that dimension""

""You are tremendously limited by your assumptions""

""You have to die to fully exfoliate in this dimension""

""Sometimes I think what human history pushes for is the extermination of all life on the planet for the simple reason that we'll never be free til then, that we are in some kind of hell world and we are locked in a world of matter and energy and space and time""

""We are living death at this moment and that we must die to be born again, somehow what we are has become trapped in a lower dimensional matrix and our greatest delusion is to claim to this most tenaciously""

That being it was made in 9 months, is using a new mechanism (mRNA), and pharma has no liabilities. On page 15 of the FDA Packet Insert for comirnaty it sates, **""COMIRNATY has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or impairment of male fertility.""** That is true for MMR and DTaP absorbed as well, however those aren't mandatory, besides, those vaccines went under normal testing parameters being greater than 4 years so anything of the like would be noticed.

 It wasn't just the conservatives who cancelled them, the Media played a huge role. This was before social media so for something to go ""viral"" the mainstream media was essential.

 Back then liberals were antiwar and conservatives seemed to really like Bush probably because after the contention of the 2000 election they had dug in their heels about Bush being a winner, but most likely because the msm was fanning the flames of division and hate (per usual).

You may ask yourself, ""people will never buy this narrative"".  Oh really?  Please recall just a year ago these fucks on the left were talking mad shit about the injection.  The masses will buy the new narrative and the ""vaccine"" that was once virtuous and good will now be Orange-Man bad.  

Trump's messaging efforts lately are on point and he will not make the same mistakes as last time.  This is why the cabal/TPTB/whatever you want to call them will be desperate and execute this operation.

Comment,1,hbeojma,,0,1630642726.0,">""two weeks to flatten the curve"" wasn't ""two weeks to make Covid magically disappear"", it was ""two weeks to slow down emergency cases so that hospitals aren't overrun"".

>And people couldn't even handle that. We have evidence of what can happen if people are willing to be mildly inconvenienced for the good of their community, New Zealand managed to eradicate Covid within their borders after 5 months, and from there only people trying to enter had to be quarantined while everyone else went on as normal. But American individualism abhores doing anything for the wider community if it doesn't immediately benifit them, so instead we had protests against basic counter contagious disease measures that have been used since biblical times, and giant rallies, ignoring said measures I might add, for a guy who promised Covid would magically disappear with no effort on their part.

Just copying a comment I already made as why reinvent the wheel.

Kangaroo Drop Zone July 28 near Charters Towers Australia, as part of simulated Joint Forcible Entry Operation during Exercise Talisman Sabre 21 – the largest military exercise conducted between Australia and the United States.

More than 100 paratroopers from 3rd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division, “Spartan Brigade,” based out of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, executed a parachute drop from Royal Australian Air Force C-17A Globemaster III aircraft onto a drop zone located in Northeastern Australia.

“This is one of the large-scale activities that Exercise Talisman Sabre is renowned for,” said Australian Army Maj. Gen. Jake Ellwood, Deployable Joint Force Headquarters commander. “It’s a demonstration of immense skill by a highly-trained team, and a true test of our ability to operate together.”

The event was part of a larger simulated JFEO overseen by the U.S. Army’s 4th Infantry Division Forward Command Post acting as the Combined Land Forces Component Command headquarters for this phase of TS21.

“A JFEO is a complex military operation that synchronizes multi-domain capabilities such as air, land, sea, information, space, cyberspace and other domains to seize key terrain,” said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Eric Strong, CFLCC commander and senior U.S. military officer on the ground for TS21.

“This is really important work we’re doing here with our key allies, the Australians,” said Strong. “I’m grateful for their hospitality and support. Our Soldiers are doing a great job and I couldn’t be prouder. It’s a significant commitment to be away from home and family, but when I look at the lasting impacts of our efforts: increased readiness, stronger bonds with allies and partners and a safer, securer world – I know it’s worth it.”

Comment,1,hbeo6sb,,0,1630642520.0,"Not only this but they were terrible pilots who on 9/11 pulled off flight maneuvers that expert pilots say impossible. Another interesting dive is into accounts of large number of high jackers being spotted alive years/decades after 9/11. Amazing how these terrorist Kamikaze planes into targets which instantly blows planes and passengers to pieces smaller than a dime (if believe commercial airline planes with passengers were used) yet they walked away alive and well to continue their lives. 

Another area to investigate is the amount of (lack of) video/photo evidence of highjackers entering airport, going through security, walking terminals, arriving at gates, and boarding planes. Not just of one terrorist group but between 4 groups/flights which you would think would be plentiful and overwhelming. Yet there have been 2 video clips released showing 2 of highjackers entering airport. But even those short clips are void of date/time stamp shown on all other video recordings from airports so whose to say when they were actually recorded. 

One more quick detail that humors me is the government’s knowledge of the commercial plane highjackings and targets months before attacks. And not only were resources not put in place to counteract plots but government decided to hold War Game Simulation across nation involving all military and government agencies which not only confused initiall response times but moved resources (such as fighter jets) so far away from attacks that were useless.

Comment,1,hbentis,,0,1630642310.0,"Fellow West Aussie here, down south.
You're not wrong about the mentality in this state. Majority of people are sucked in to this narrative out of fear. I've watched a close family member go from never taking panadol in their life to lining up for a jab because society says so.
All my extended family are in Sydney and the effects it's had on the infants/toddlers is something they won't come back from. 
I live out in a national park amongst nature and with a beach 200m away. Not much better for the mind, body and soul than nature and salt air.
I've never bothered signing in. I've had a few looks and a couple comments but it doesn't phase me in the least. We've not even had one case down here since this started. People seem to have forgotten someone has to have it to spread it.
I did witness a woman who's hands turned completely black and I last heard (don't quote me on it) they were amputated and that was after the jab.
That being said another person down this way was one of the first to contract covid on a cruise ship and all her hair fell out and she's been having constant issues.

Comment,1,hbens7t,,0,1630642290.0,"Magnets are really interesting. So if you start at the molecular level you have molecules of a solid substance arranged in geometric shapes called crystals. These crystals are sometimes arranged in way that the molecules forming them have a uneven amount of electrons across the arrangement causing one end to be negative and the other positive. This creates something called a domain. In most material the poles of the domains are arranged randomly in the material creating an overall neutral charge across it. However in natural magnets their domains line up. Think of it this way, imagine you have a bunch of triple A batteries and arrange them in a line positive to negative. This results in a cascading effect that increases the voltage or difference in charge between the ends of the lines in the battery with each battery added. One single battery is 1.5 volts, add another in line to get 3 volts another to get 4.5 volts and so on. The same thing happens in a permanent magnet. The dipole domains line up to create a stronger difference in the poles creating a North and South pole across the entire material. When a piece of iron enters the field created by the magnet the field influences the domains in the metal lining them up to turn the iron into its own magnet. Since it now has its own poles they get attracted to the permanent magnet.",2021-09-03 04:11:30

Comment,1,hbenng8,,0,1630642216.0,"It’s not accurate to say the therapy now has any fetal tissue. The fact is that in initial testing decades ago, stem cells where used to test this treatment. (Not saying in ok with this, just clarifying what’s going on)
But it’s completely inaccurate to make it seem like today’s treatments or the current drug has ANY fetal tissue whatsoever.

>In a statement to NBC News, Regeneron spokesperson Alexandra Bowie said that the company used cells from a cell line called HEK293T. These cells date back to the 1970s and were originally taken from kidney cells in donated fetal tissue.

Because of this, the cells are considered “immortalized.”

Comment,1,hbeniya,,0,1630642148.0,"Cute attempt at labeling and divisivness.

I am not anti-vaxx, I have taken all of the fully tested vaccines, including those required by the US military (USMC), pre-Covid.

And to back that statement, one of those shots was the infamous 'PB&J' shot in the butt cheek.  (Not enjoyable, lol)

I also survived the H1N1 Swine Flu in 2009, by taking Tamiflu (anti-viral).

If someone chooses with their own free will, un-manipulated to have this experimental injection, I fully respect their choice.

Additionally, it appears the FDA (and Big Pharma) skipped phase 2 and 3 of the clinical trials to approve it for ages 16 and above, completed clinical trials is set for 2023:

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728

After publicly condoning not taking a free vaccine, as it wasn’t formally FDA approved at the time, Joe Rogan then went on take to 50k-100k worth of non-formally approved lab-made antibodies. He also took prednisone, ivermectin, and antibiotics; ivermectin isn’t approved in any way. He has spent the last year claiming the disease shouldn’t be worried about, that a healthy individual could beat it without any treatment. He then went and threw the kitchen sink at it in a way none of his listeners could, with treatments that fall in the same category as the vaccine. Unapproved and lab-made.

2. The mainstream media has been demonizing anything against the official covid narrative. There are millions of social media minions doing their grunt work like good little worker ants.

3. The most important theory to me is the idea that societies are set up to keep resources and decision making power in the hands of a few. Rules, laws, traditions, even the way cities are designed, will usually reinforce this. We teach and socialize poor kids to spend money on false status and stay numb enough with drugs and alcohol so they have just enough strength to provide labor (for a small salary, taxed of course) but not to question or rise up socially.

Comment,1,hbem04z,,0,1630641316.0,"they actually did let the nazis go., you should read a history book about ww2. and no im not joking

one of the top women involved in the ww2 propaganda films for the nazis lived the rest of her life in freedom  to the age of 101

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl

the only nazis who were put on trial were actual SS members who were guilty of war crimes, who directly were in the death camps. none of the other ones were punished. the SS was the higher up ranking nazis who were skulls on their hats and even out of those a small % were in charge of death camps. 

remember if germany had actually jailed / killed every nazi there would have been no german left

a lot of redditors just dont know history at all.  the largest portion of the germans supported hitler to their dying days and they still didn't understand why there was such a coalition to have him removed from power. they were lining in the streets to see him and crying at the sight of him. 

I have seen the german documentaries where they admit that everyone among them was crying who would look upon him.

You’re basically giving up control of your natural immunities for a synthetic version of it. Now world governments could potentially infiltrate and expose you to man made virus’s because they know how your body is going to react. 

It’s just so stupid and obvious what is going on here. Humanity is being systematically attacked from all fronts. 

Anyone who chooses to attack the virus through mRNA vaccination is acting out of fear and not critically thinking about the realities of the world they live in. This is what the internet has done to people. Made them fearful dumb sheep.

Article explaining that blood clots from the spike protein interacting with our platelets are associated with both COVID-19 infection and vaccination: https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003648 

Article explains that just the S1 subunit of the spike protein can cause platelets to clot: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.21252960v1

More evidence that spike proteins do not stay on the cell membranes but end up circulating in the blood. This study aims to explain the blood clots caused by the J&J and AstraZeneca adenovector vaccines, they claim that the DNA isn't properly spliced and the spike proteins end up in the blood causing thrombosis when the spikes attach to the ACE2 receptors of the endothelial cells: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-558954/v1

Article on how the spike protein in vaccines can cause cell damage via cell signaling: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7827936/ 

Article that when the spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor it causes the release of soluble IL-6R which acts as a extracellular signal which causes inflammation (see the first paper for evidence that the spike causes the release of IL-6R and see the second paper for an explanation of how soluble IL-6R causes pro-inflamatory extracellular signaling: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33284859/ And https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491447/
